3005.   [port]          Solaris: Work around the lack of

2988.   [experimental]  Added a "dlopen" DLZ driver, allowing the creation
                        of external DLZ drivers that can be loaded as
                        shared objects at runtime rather than linked with
                        named.  Currently this is switched on via a
                        compile-time option, "configure --with-dlz-dlopen".
                        Note: the syntax for configuring DLZ zones
                        is likely to be refined in future releases.

                        Zone configuration information for the new zones
                        will be written into that file.  To make the new

2644.   [bug]           Change #2628 caused a regression on some systems;
                        named was unable to write the PID file and would

2629.   [port]          Check for seteuid()/setegid(), use setresuid()/
                        setresgid() if not present. [RT #19932]

2628.   [port]          linux: Allow /var/run/named/named.pid to be opened
                        at startup with reduced capabilities in operation.

2566.	[cleanup]	Clarify logged message when an insecure DNSSEC
			response arrives from a zone thought to be secure:
			"insecurity proof failed" instead of "not

2834.	[bug]		HMAC-SHA* keys that were longer than the algorithm
			digest length were used incorrectly, leading to
			interoperability problems with other DNS
			implementations.  This has been corrected.
			(Note: If an oversize key is in use, and
			compatibility is needed with an older release of
			BIND, the new tool "isc-hmac-fixup" can convert
			the key secret to a form that will work with all
			versions.) [RT #20751]

3052.	[test]		Fixed last autosign test report. [RT #23256]

3054.	[bug]		Added elliptic curve support check in
			GOST OpenSSL engine detection. [RT #23485]

3057.	[bug]		"rndc secroots" would abort after the first error

3072.	[bug]		dns_dns64_aaaaok() potential NULL pointer dereference.
			[RT #20256]

3073.	[bug]		managed-keys changes were not properly being recorded.

			timestamp when determining which keys are active.
			[RT #23642]

3077.	[bug]		zone.c:zone_refreshkeys() incorrectly called
			dns_zone_attach(), use zone->irefs instead. [RT #23303]

3082.	[port]		strtok_r is threads only. [RT #23747]

3086.	[bug]		Running dnssec-settime -f on an old-style key will
			now force an update to the new key format even if no
			other change has been specified, using "-P now -A now"
			as default values.  [RT #22474]

3087.	[bug]		DDNS updates using SIG(0) with update-policy match
			type "external" could cause a crash. [RT #23735]

3091.	[bug]		Fixed a bug in which zone keys that were published
			and then subsequently activated could fail to trigger
			automatic signing. [RT #22911]

3094.	[doc]		Expand dns64 documentation.

3096.	[bug]		Set KRB5_KTNAME before calling log_cred() in
			dst_gssapi_acceptctx(). [RT #24004]
