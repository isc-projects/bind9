2988.	[experimental]	Added a "dlopen" DLZ driver, allowing the creation

2930.	[experimental]	New "rndc addzone" and "rndc delzone" commads
			allow dynamic addition and deletion of zones.
			To enable this feature, specify a "new-zone-file"
			option at the view or options level in named.conf.
			Zone configuration information for the new zones
			will be written into that file.  To make the new
			zones persist after a restart, "include" the file
			into named.conf in the appropriate view.  (Note:
			This feature is not yet documented, and its syntax
			is expected to change.) [RT #19447]

2835.	[bug]		Key inactivity dates were inadvertently stored in
			the private key file with the outdated tag
			"Unpublish" rather than "Inactive".  This has been

			dates set will now need to have them reset, using
			'dnssec-settime -I'. [RT #20868]

2834.	[bug]		HMAC-SHA* keys that were longer than the algorithm
			digest length were used incorrectly, leading to
			interoperability problems with other DNS
			implementations.  This has been corrected.
			(Note: If an oversize key is in use, and
			compatibility is needed with an older release of
			BIND, the new tool "isc-hmac-fixup" can convert
			the key secret to a form that will work with all

2807.	[bug]		Fixed a possible ASSERT when reconfiguring zone
			keys. [RT #20720]

2806.	[bug]		"rdnc sign" could delay re-signing the DNSKEY
			when it had changed. [RT #20703]

2805.	[bug]		Fixed namespace problems encountered when building
			external programs using non-exported BIND9 libraries
			(i.e., built without --enable-exportlib). [RT #20679]

2804.	[bug]		Send notifies when a zone is signed with "rndc sign"
			or as a result of a scheduled key change. [RT #20700]
