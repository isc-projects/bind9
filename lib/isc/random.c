		 * within 32 bits:
		 *
		 *     (1 << 32) % limit
		 * == ((1 << 32) - limit) % limit
		 * ==  (uint32_t)(-limit) % limit

		 * `limit`, so our results will be unbiased; and `N` is the
		 * largest multiple that fits in 32 bits, so rejections are as
		 * rare as possible.
		 *
		 * There are `limit` possible values for the integer part of
		 * our fixed-point number. Each one corresponds to `N/limit`
		 * or `N/limit + 1` possible fraction parts. For our result to
		 * be unbiased, every possible integer part must have the same
		 * number of possible valid fraction parts. So, when we get
		 * the superfluous value in the `N/limit + 1` cases, we need
		 * to reject and resample.
		 *
		 * Because of the multiplication, the possible values in the
		 * fraction part are equally spaced by `limit`, with varying
		 * gaps at each end of the fraction's 32-bit range. We will
		 * choose a range of size `N` (a multiple of `limit`) into
		 * which valid fraction values must fall, with the rest of the
		 * 32-bit range covered by the `residue`. Lemire's paper says
		 * that exactly `N/limit` possible values spaced apart by
		 * `limit` will fit into our size `N` valid range, regardless
		 * of the size of the end gaps, the phase alignment of the
		 * values, or the position of the range.
		 *
		 * So, when a fraction value falls in the `residue` outside
		 * our valid range, it is superfluous, and we resample.
