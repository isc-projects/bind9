.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These functions provide hostname\-to\-address and address\-to\-hostname lookups by means of the lightweight resolver\&. They are similar to the standard \fBgethostent\fR(3) functions provided by most operating systems\&. They use a \fBstruct hostent\fR which is usually defined in \fI<namedb\&.h>\fR\&.
.PP
.nf
struct  hostent {
        char    *h_name;        /* official name of host */
        char    **h_aliases;    /* alias list */
        int     h_addrtype;     /* host address type */
        int     h_length;       /* length of address */
        char    **h_addr_list;  /* list of addresses from name server */
};
#define h_addr  h_addr_list[0]  /* address, for backward compatibility */
.fi
.PP
The members of this structure are: 
.TP
\fBh_name\fR
The official (canonical) name of the host\&.
.TP
\fBh_aliases\fR
A NULL\-terminated array of alternate names (nicknames) for the host\&.
.TP
\fBh_addrtype\fR
The type of address being returned -- \fBPF_INET\fR or \fBPF_INET6\fR\&.
.TP
\fBh_length\fR
The length of the address in bytes\&.
.TP
\fBh_addr_list\fR
A \fBNULL\fR terminated array of network addresses for the host\&. Host addresses are returned in network byte order\&.
.PP
For backward compatibility with very old software, \fBh_addr\fR is the first address in \fBh_addr_list\&.\fR 
.PP
\fBlwres_gethostent()\fR, \fBlwres_sethostent()\fR, \fBlwres_endhostent()\fR, \fBlwres_gethostent_r()\fR, \fBlwres_sethostent_r()\fR and \fBlwres_endhostent_r()\fR provide iteration over the known host entries on systems that provide such functionality through facilities like \fI/etc/hosts\fR or NIS\&. The lightweight resolver does not currently implement these functions; it only provides them as stub functions that always return failure\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_gethostbyname()\fR and \fBlwres_gethostbyname2()\fR look up the hostname \fIname\fR\&. \fBlwres_gethostbyname()\fR always looks for an IPv4 address while \fBlwres_gethostbyname2()\fR looks for an address of protocol family \fIaf\fR: either \fBPF_INET\fR or \fBPF_INET6\fR -- IPv4 or IPV6 addresses respectively\&. Successful calls of the functions return a \fBstruct hostent\fRfor the name that was looked up\&. \fBNULL\fR is returned if the lookups by \fBlwres_gethostbyname()\fR or \fBlwres_gethostbyname2()\fR fail\&.
.PP
Reverse lookups of addresses are performed by \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr()\fR\&. \fIaddr\fR is an address of length \fIlen\fR bytes and protocol family \fItype\fR -- \fBPF_INET\fR or \fBPF_INET6\fR\&. \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR is a thread\-safe function for forward lookups\&. If an error occurs, an error code is returned in \fI*error\fR\&. \fIresbuf\fR is a pointer to a \fBstruct hostent\fR which is initialised by a successful call to \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR\&. \fIbuf\fR is a buffer of length \fIlen\fR bytes which is used to store the \fBh_name\fR, \fBh_aliases\fR, and \fBh_addr_list\fR elements of the \fBstruct hostent\fR returned in \fIresbuf\fR\&. Successful calls to \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR return \fIresbuf\fR, which is a pointer to the \fBstruct hostent\fR it created\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_gethostbyaddr_r()\fR is a thread\-safe function that performs a reverse lookup of address \fIaddr\fR which is \fIlen\fR bytes long and is of protocol family \fItype\fR -- \fBPF_INET\fR or \fBPF_INET6\fR\&. If an error occurs, the error code is returned in \fI*error\fR\&. The other function parameters are identical to those in \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR\&. \fIresbuf\fR is a pointer to a \fBstruct hostent\fR which is initialised by a successful call to \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr_r()\fR\&. \fIbuf\fR is a buffer of length \fIlen\fR bytes which is used to store the \fBh_name\fR, \fBh_aliases\fR, and \fBh_addr_list\fR elements of the \fBstruct hostent\fR returned in \fIresbuf\fR\&. Successful calls to \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr_r()\fR return \fIresbuf\fR, which is a pointer to the \fBstruct hostent()\fR it created\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
The functions \fBlwres_gethostbyname()\fR, \fBlwres_gethostbyname2()\fR, \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr()\fR, and \fBlwres_gethostent()\fR return NULL to indicate an error\&. In this case the global variable \fBlwres_h_errno\fR will contain one of the following error codes defined in \fI<lwres/netdb\&.h>\fR: 
.TP
\fBHOST_NOT_FOUND\fR
The host or address was not found\&.
.TP
\fBTRY_AGAIN\fR
A recoverable error occurred, e\&.g\&., a timeout\&. Retrying the lookup may succeed\&.
.TP
\fBNO_RECOVERY\fR
A non\-recoverable error occurred\&.
.TP
\fBNO_DATA\fR
The name exists, but has no address information associated with it (or vice versa in the case of a reverse lookup)\&. The code NO_ADDRESS is accepted as a synonym for NO_DATA for backwards compatibility\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_hstrerror\fR(3) translates these error codes to suitable error messages\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_gethostent()\fR and \fBlwres_gethostent_r()\fR always return \fBNULL\fR\&.
.PP
Successful calls to \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR and \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr_r()\fR return \fIresbuf\fR, a pointer to the \fBstruct hostent\fR that was initialised by these functions\&. They return \fBNULL\fR if the lookups fail or if \fIbuf\fR was too small to hold the list of addresses and names referenced by the \fBh_name\fR, \fBh_aliases\fR, and \fBh_addr_list\fR elements of the \fBstruct hostent\fR\&. If \fIbuf\fR was too small, both \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR and \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr_r()\fR set the global variable \fBerrno\fR to \fBERANGE\fR\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBgethostent\fR(3), \fBlwres_getipnode\fR(3), \fBlwres_hstrerror\fR(3) 
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBlwres_gethostbyname()\fR, \fBlwres_gethostbyname2()\fR, \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr()\fR and \fBlwres_endhostent()\fR are not thread safe; they return pointers to static data and provide error codes through a global variable\&. Thread\-safe versions for name and address lookup are provided by \fBlwres_gethostbyname_r()\fR, and \fBlwres_gethostbyaddr_r()\fR respectively\&.
.PP
The resolver daemon does not currently support any non\-DNS name services such as \fI/etc/hosts\fR or \fBNIS\fR, consequently the above functions don't, either\&.
