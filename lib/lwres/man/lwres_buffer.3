.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These functions provide bounds checked access to a region of memory where data is being read or written\&. They are based on, and similar to, the isc_buffer_ functions in the ISC library\&.
.PP
A buffer is a region of memory, together with a set of related subregions\&. The \fIused region\fR and the \fIavailable\fR region are disjoint, and their union is the buffer's region\&. The used region extends from the beginning of the buffer region to the last used byte\&. The available region extends from one byte greater than the last used byte to the end of the buffer's region\&. The size of the used region can be changed using various buffer commands\&. Initially, the used region is empty\&.
.PP
The used region is further subdivided into two disjoint regions: the \fIconsumed region\fR and the \fIremaining region\fR\&. The union of these two regions is the used region\&. The consumed region extends from the beginning of the used region to the byte before the \fIcurrent\fR offset (if any)\&. The \fIremaining\fR region the current pointer to the end of the used region\&. The size of the consumed region can be changed using various buffer commands\&. Initially, the consumed region is empty\&.
.PP
The \fIactive region\fR is an (optional) subregion of the remaining region\&. It extends from the current offset to an offset in the remaining region\&. Initially, the active region is empty\&. If the current offset advances beyond the chosen offset, the active region will also be empty\&.

.PP
\fBlwres_buffer_init()\fR initializes the \fBlwres_buffer_t\fR  \fI*b\fR and assocates it with the memory region of size \fIlength\fR bytes starting at location \fIbase\&.\fR 
.PP
\fBlwres_buffer_invalidate()\fR marks the buffer \fI*b\fR as invalid\&. Invalidating a buffer after use is not required, but makes it possible to catch its possible accidental use\&.
.PP
The functions \fBlwres_buffer_add()\fR and \fBlwres_buffer_subtract()\fR respectively increase and decrease the used space in buffer \fI*b\fR by \fIn\fR bytes\&. \fBlwres_buffer_add()\fR checks for buffer overflow and \fBlwres_buffer_subtract()\fR checks for underflow\&. These functions do not allocate or deallocate memory\&. They just change the value of used\&.
.PP
A buffer is re\-initialised by \fBlwres_buffer_clear()\fR\&. The function sets used, current and active to zero\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_buffer_first\fR makes the consumed region of buffer \fI*p\fR empty by setting current to zero (the start of the buffer)\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_buffer_forward()\fR increases the consumed region of buffer \fI*b\fR by \fIn\fR bytes, checking for overflow\&. Similarly, \fBlwres_buffer_back()\fR decreases buffer \fIb\fR's consumed region by \fIn\fR bytes and checks for underflow\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_buffer_getuint8()\fR reads an unsigned 8\-bit integer from \fI*b\fR and returns it\&. \fBlwres_buffer_putuint8()\fR writes the unsigned 8\-bit integer \fIval\fR to buffer \fI*b\fR\&.
.PP
\fBlwres_buffer_getuint16()\fR and \fBlwres_buffer_getuint32()\fR are identical to \fBlwres_buffer_putuint8()\fR except that they respectively read an unsigned 16\-bit or 32\-bit integer in network byte order from \fIb\fR\&. Similarly, \fBlwres_buffer_putuint16()\fR and \fBlwres_buffer_putuint32()\fR writes the unsigned 16\-bit or 32\-bit integer \fIval\fR to buffer \fIb\fR, in network byte order\&.
.PP
Arbitrary amounts of data are read or written from a lightweight resolver buffer with \fBlwres_buffer_getmem()\fR and \fBlwres_buffer_putmem()\fR respectively\&. \fBlwres_buffer_putmem()\fR copies \fIlength\fR bytes of memory at \fIbase\fR to \fIb\fR\&. Conversely, \fBlwres_buffer_getmem()\fR copies \fIlength\fR bytes of memory from \fIb\fR to \fIbase\fR\&.
