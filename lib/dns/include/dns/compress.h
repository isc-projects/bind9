/*! \file dns/compress.h
 * Direct manipulation of the structures is strongly discouraged.
 *
 * A name compression context handles compression of multiple DNS names in
 * relation to a single DNS message. The context can be used to selectively
 * turn on/off compression for specific names (depending on the RR type,
 * according to RFC 3597) by using \c dns_compress_setpermitted().
 *
 * The nameserver can be configured not to use compression at all using
 * \c dns_compress_disable().
 *
 * DNS name compression only needs exact matches on (suffixes of) names. We
 * could use a data structure that supports longest-match lookups, but that
 * would introduce a lot of heavyweight machinery, and all we need is
 * something that exists very briefly to store a few names before it is
 * thrown away.
 *
 * In the abstract we need a map from DNS names to compression offsets. But
 * a compression offset refers to a point in the message where the name has
 * been written. So in fact all we need is a hash set of compression offsets.
 *
 * Typical messages do not contain more than a few dozen names, so by
 * default our hash set is small (64 entries, 256 bytes). It can be
 * enlarged when a message is likely to contain a lot of names, such as for
 * outgoing zone transfers (which are handled in lib/ns/xfrout.c) and
 * update requests (for which nsupdate uses DNS_REQUESTOPT_LARGE - see
 * request.h).
 */

/*
 * Logarithms of hash set sizes. In the usual (small) case, allow for for a
 * few dozen names in the hash set. (We can't actually use every slot because
 * space is reserved for performance reasons.) For large messages, the number
 * of names is limited by the minimum size of an RR (owner, type, class, ttl,
 * length) which is 12 bytes - call it 16 bytes to make space for a new label.
 * Divide the maximum compression offset 0x4000 by 16 and you get 0x400 == 1024.
 * In practice, the root zone (for example) uses less than 200 distinct names
 * per message.
