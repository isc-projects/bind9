/*! \file dns/resolver.h
 *
 * \brief
 * This is the BIND 9 resolver, the module responsible for resolving DNS
 * requests by iteratively querying authoritative servers and following
 * referrals.  This is a "full resolver", not to be confused with
 * the stub resolvers most people associate with the word "resolver".
 * The full resolver is part of the caching name server or resolver
 * daemon the stub resolver talks to.
 *
 * MP:
 *\li	The module ensures appropriate synchronization of data structures it
 *	creates and manipulates.
 *
 * Reliability:
 *\li	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * Resources:
 *\li	TBS
 *
 * Security:
 *\li	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * Standards:
 *\li	RFCs:	1034, 1035, 2181, TBS
 *\li	Drafts:	TBS
