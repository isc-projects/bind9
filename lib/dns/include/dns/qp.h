/*
 * A qp-trie is a kind of key -> value map, supporting lookups that are
 * aware of the lexicographic order of keys.
 *
 * Keys are `dns_qpkey_t`, which is a string-like thing, usually created
 * from a DNS name. You can use both relative and absolute DNS names as
 * keys, even in the same trie, except for one caveat: if a trie contains
 * names relative to the zone apex, the natural way to represent the apex
 * itself (spelled `@` in zone files) is a zero-length name; but a
 * zero-length name has the same qpkey representation as the root zone
 * (apart from its length), so they collide.
 *
 * Leaf values are a pair of a `void *` pointer and a `uint32_t`
 * (because that is what fits inside an internal qp-trie leaf node).
 *
 * The trie does not store keys; instead keys are derived from leaf values
 * by calling a method provided by the user.
 *
 * There are a few flavours of qp-trie.
 *
 * The basic `dns_qp_t` supports single-threaded read/write access.
 *
 * A `dns_qpmulti_t` is a wrapper that supports multithreaded access.
 * There can be many concurrent readers and a single writer. Writes are
 * transactional, and support multi-version concurrency.
 *
 * The concurrency strategy uses copy-on-write. When making changes during
 * a transaction, the caller must not modify leaf values in place, but
 * instead delete the old leaf from the trie and insert a replacement. Leaf
 * values have reference counts, which will indicate when the old leaf
 * value can be freed after it is no longer needed by readers using an old
 * version of the trie.
 *
 * For fast concurrent reads, call `dns_qpmulti_query()` to fill in a
 * `dns_qpread_t`, which must be allocated on the stack. This gives
 * the reader access to a single version of the trie. The reader's
 * thread must be registered with `liburcu`, which is normally taken
 * care of by `libisc`. Readers are not blocked by any write activity,
 * and vice versa.
 *
 * For reads that need a stable view of the trie for multiple cycles
 * of an isc_loop, or which can be used from any thread, call
 * `dns_qpmulti_snapshot()` to get a `dns_qpsnap_t`. A snapshot is for
 * relatively heavy long-running read-only operations such as zone
 * transfers.
 *
 * You can start one read-write transaction at a time using
 * `dns_qpmulti_write()` or `dns_qpmulti_update()`. Either way, you
 * get a `dns_qp_t` that can be modified like a single-threaded trie,
 * without affecting other read-only query or snapshot users of the
 * `dns_qpmulti_t`.
 *
 * "Update" transactions are heavyweight. They allocate working memory to
 * hold modifications to the trie, and compact the trie before committing.
 * For extra space savings, a partially-used allocation chunk is shrunk to
 * the smallest size possible. Unlike "write" transactions, an "update"
 * transaction can be rolled back instead of committed. (Update
 * transactions are intended for things like authoritative zones, where it
 * is important to keep the per-trie memory overhead low because there can
 * be a very large number of them.)
 *
 * "Write" transactions are more lightweight: they skip the allocation and
 * compaction at the start and end of the transaction. (Write transactions
 * are intended for frequent small changes, as in the DNS cache.)
