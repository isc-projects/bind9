 *\brief
 * DNS Address Database
 *
 * This module implements an address database (ADB) for mapping a name
 * to an isc_sockaddr_t. It also provides statistical information on
 * how good that address might be.
 *
 * A client will pass in a dns_name_t, and the ADB will walk through
 * the rdataset looking up addresses associated with the name.  If it
 * is found on the internal lists, a structure is filled in with the
 * address information and stats for found addresses.
 *
 * If the name cannot be found on the internal lists, a new entry will
 * be created for a name if all the information needed can be found
 * in the zone table or cache.  This new address will then be returned.
 *
 * If a request must be made to remote servers to satisfy a name lookup,
 * this module will start fetches to try to complete these addresses.  When
 * at least one more completes, an event is sent to the caller.  If none of
 * them resolve before the fetch times out, an event indicating this is
 * sent instead.
 *
 * Records are stored internally until a timer expires. The timer is the
 * smaller of the TTL or signature validity period.
 *
 * MP:
 *
 *\li	The ADB takes care of all necessary locking.
 *
 *\li	Only the task which initiated the name lookup can cancel the lookup.
 *
 *
 * Security:
 *
 *\li	None, since all data stored is required to be pre-filtered.
 *	(Cache needs to be sane, fetches return bounds-checked and sanity-
 *       checked data, caller passes a good dns_name_t for the zone, etc)

 * Main interface for clients. The adb will look up the name given in

 * internal fetches to resolve names that are unknown currently.
 *
 * If other addresses resolve after this call completes, the 'cb' callback
 * will be called with a pointer to the dns_adbfind_t returned by this
 * structure, which in turn has a pointer to the callback argument passed
 * in as 'cbarg'. The caller is responsible for freeing the find object.
 *
 * If no events will be generated, the *find->result_v4 and/or result_v6
 * members may be examined for address lookup status.  The usual #ISC_R_SUCCESS,
 * #ISC_R_FAILURE, #DNS_R_NXDOMAIN, and #DNS_R_NXRRSET are returned, along with
 * #ISC_R_NOTFOUND meaning the ADB has not _yet_ found the values.  In this
 * latter case, retrying may produce more addresses.
 *
 * If events will be returned, the result_v[46] members are only valid
 * when that event is actually returned.
 *
 * The list of addresses returned is unordered.  The caller must impose
 * any ordering required.  The list will not contain "known bad" addresses,
 * however.
 *
 * The caller cannot (directly) modify the contents of the address list's
 * fields other than the "link" field.  All values can be read at any
 * time, however.
 *
 * The "now" parameter is used only for determining which entries that
 * have a specific time to live or expire time should be removed from
 * the running database.  If specified as zero, the current time will
 * be retrieved and used.
 *
 * If 'target' is not NULL and 'name' is an alias (i.e. the name is
 * CNAME'd or DNAME'd to another name), then 'target' will be updated with
 * the domain name that 'name' is aliased to.
 *
 * All addresses returned will have the sockaddr's port set to 'port.'
 * The caller may change them directly in the dns_adbaddrinfo_t since
 * they are copies of the internal address only.
 *
 * Requires:
 *
 *\li	*adb be a valid isc_adb_t object.
 *
 *\li	If events are to be sent, *loop be a valid loop,
 *	and cb != NULL.
 *
 *\li	*name is a valid dns_name_t.
 *
 *\li	qname != NULL and *qname be a valid dns_name_t.
 *
 *\li	target == NULL or target is a valid name with a buffer.
 *
 *\li	find != NULL && *find == NULL.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *\li	#ISC_R_SUCCESS	Addresses might have been returned, and events will be
 *			delivered for unresolved addresses.
 *\li	#ISC_R_NOMORE	Addresses might have been returned, but no events
 *			will ever be posted for this context.  This is only
 *			returned if task != NULL.
 *\li	#ISC_R_NOMEMORY	insufficient resources
 *\li	#DNS_R_ALIAS	'name' is an alias for another name.
