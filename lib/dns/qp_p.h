 *
 *  interior node basics

/*
 * A qp-trie node is almost always one of two types: branch or leaf.
 * (A third type is used only to anchor the root of a trie; see below.)
 *
 * A node contains a 64-bit word and a 32-bit word. In order to avoid
 * unwanted padding, they are declared as three 32-bit words; this keeps
 * the size down to 12 bytes. They are in native endian order, so getting
 * the 64-bit part should compile down to an unaligned load.
 *
 * The node type is identified by the least significant bits of the 64-bit
 * word.
 *
 * In a leaf node:
 * - The 64-bit word is used to store a pointer value. (Pointers must be
 *   word-aligned so the least significant bits are zero; those bits can
 *   then act as a node tag to indicate that this is a leaf. This
 *   requirement is enforced by the make_leaf() constructor.)
 * - The 32-bit word is used to store an integer value.  Both the
 *   pointer and integer values can be retrieved when looking up a key.
 *
 * In a branch node:
 * - The 64-bit word is subdivided into three portions: the least
 *   significant bits are the node type (for a branch, 0x1); the
 *   most sigificant 15 bits are an offset value into the key, and
 *   the 47 bits in the middle are a bitmap; see the documentation
 *   for the SHIFT_* enum below.
 * - The 32-bit word is a reference (dns_qpref_t) to the packed sparse
 *   vector of "twigs", i.e. child nodes. A branch node has at least
 *   two and at most 47 twigs. (The qp-trie update functions ensure that
 *   branches actually branch, i.e. a branch cannot have only one child.)
 *
 * A third node type, reader nodes, anchors the root of a trie.
 * A pair of reader nodes together contain a packed `dns_qpreader_t`.
 * See the section on "packed reader nodes" for details.

 * The following enum sets up the bit positions of these parts.
 *
 * The bitmap is just above the type tag. The `dns_qp_bits_for_byte[]` table
 * is used to fill in a key so that bit tests can work directly against the
 * index word without superfluous masking or shifting; we don't need to
 * mask out the bitmap before testing a bit, but we do need to mask the
 * bitmap before calling popcount.
 *
 * The byte offset into the key is at the top of the word, so that it
 * can be extracted with just a shift, with no masking needed.
 *
 * The names are SHIFT_thing because they are dns_qpshift_t values. (See
 * below for the various `qp_*` type declarations.)
 *
 * These values are relatively fixed in practice: SHIFT_NOBYTE needs

 * it in active use (maybe with a snapshot for rollback support).
 *
 * The two arrays are separate because they have rather different

 * is the size we need to know for shrinking the chunk and for
 * scanning it to detach leaf values before the chunk is free()d. The
 * `free` counter tells us when the chunk needs compacting and when it
 * has become empty.
 *
 * The `exists` flag allows the chunk scanning loops to look at the
 * usage array only.
 *
 * In multithreaded code, we mark chunks as `immutable` when a modify
 * transaction is opened. (We don't mark them immutable on commit,
 * because the old bump chunk must remain mutable between write
 * transactions, but it must become immutable when an update
 * transaction is opened.)
 *
 * There are a few flags used to mark which chunks are still needed by

 * Read-write access to a qp-trie requires extra fields to support the
 * allocator and garbage collector.
 *
 * Bare instances of a `struct dns_qp` are used for stand-alone
 * single-threaded tries. For multithreaded access, a `dns_qpmulti_t`
 * wraps a `dns_qp_t` with a mutex and other fields that are only needed
 * at the start or end of a transaction.
 *
 * Allocations are made sequentially in the `bump` chunk. A sequence
 * of lightweight write transactions can use the same `bump` chunk, so
 * its prefix before `fender` is immutable, and the rest is mutable.
 *
 * To decide when to compact and reclaim space, QP_MAX_GARBAGE() examines
 * the values of `used_count`, `free_count`, and `hold_count`. The
 * `hold_count` tracks nodes that need to be retained while readers are
 * using them; they are free but cannot be reclaimed until the transaction
 * has committed, so the `hold_count` is discounted from QP_MAX_GARBAGE()
 * during a transaction.
 *
 * There are some flags that alter the behaviour of write transactions.
 *
 *  - The `transaction_mode` indicates whether the current transaction is a
 *    light write or a heavy update, or (between transactions) the previous
 *    transaction's mode, because the setup for the next transaction
 *    depends on how the previous one committed. The mode is set at the
 *    start of each transaction. It is QP_NONE in a single-threaded qp-trie
 *    to detect if part of a `dns_qpmulti_t` is passed to dns_qp_destroy().
 *
 *  - The `compact_all` flag is used when every node in the trie should be
 *    copied. (Usually compation aims to avoid moving nodes out of
 *    unfragmented chunks.) It is used when compaction is explicitly
 *    requested via `dns_qp_compact()`, and as an emergency mechanism if
 *    normal compaction failed to clear the QP_MAX_GARBAGE() condition.
 *    (This emergency is a bug even tho we have a rescue mechanism.)
 *
 *  - When a qp-trie is destroyed while it has pending cleanup work, its
 *    `destroy` flag is set so that it is destroyed by the reclaim worker.
 *    (Because items cannot be removed from the middle of the cleanup list.)
 *
 *  - When built with fuzzing support, we can use mprotect() and munmap()
 *    to ensure that incorrect memory accesses cause fatal errors. The
 *    `write_protect` flag must be set straight after the `dns_qpmulti_t`
 *    is created, then left unchanged.
 *
 * Some of the dns_qp_t fields are only needed for multithreaded transactions
 * (marked [MT] below) but the same code paths are also used for single-
 * threaded writes.

 * The purpose of these packed reader nodes is to simplify safe memory
 * reclamation for a multithreaded qp-trie.
 *
 * After the `reader` pointer in a qpmulti is replaced, we need to wait
 * for a grace period before we can reclaim the memory that is no longer
 * needed by the trie. So we need some kind of structure to hold
 * pointers to the (logically) detached memory until it is safe to free.
 * This memory includes the chunks and the `base` arrays.
 *
 * Packed reader nodes save us from having to track `dns_qpread_t`
 * objects as distinct allocations: the packed reader nodes get
 * reclaimed when the the chunk containing their cells is reclaimed.
 * When a real `dns_qpread_t` object is needed, it is allocated on the
 * stack (it must not live longer than a isc_loop callback) and the
 * packed reader is unpacked into it.
 *
 * Chunks are owned by the current `base` array, so unused chunks are
 * held there until they are free()d. Old `base` arrays are attached
 * to packed reader nodes with a refcount. When a chunk is reclaimed,
 * it is scanned so that `chunk_free()` can call `detach_leaf()` on
 * any remaining references to leaf objects. Similarly, it calls
 * `qpbase_unref()` to reclaim old `base` arrays.
