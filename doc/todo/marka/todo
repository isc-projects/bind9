Fix dns_xfer

        For a long term fix I think dns_xfer should just return the zone
        or delta via the xferdone call rather than calling
        dns_zone_replacedb().  This will remove the window between
        replacing the db and updating the zone counters.  Basically
        the commits should be done by the caller via the callback.
