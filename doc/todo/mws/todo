Inspect dig and nsupdate (with Andreas)

Check AXFR under Linux v6 / 2.4.x

Check text strings for host and nslookup output of various types.

dig, isolate -x/host/nslookup ip->in-addr auto-detection and conversion
into dighost.c

nsupdate code check and cleanup.  Make sure prereq, etc... work.

Fix wpk's build/tests scripts to
 - not run if the previous test failed (to keep logs and cores around)
 - display the date and time of the last run

Big todo list for dig, from code walkthrough with Brian:
	strncpy -> isc_mem_strdup
	oname in setup_lookup can be on the stack instead of allocated
	Move INSIST in insert_lookup up
	Fix -b option in UDP mode (make sure server and bind address are
		compatible)
	Use symbolic names for exit codes
	l->retries-- can be moved out of if/else
	+tcp/vc no longer needs to be prohibited in batchfiles
	digrc filename print length shouldn't be 132
	bargc should be more than 14
	Split up launch_next_query
	0 should be dns_rcode_noerror
	How is data in additional section printer in *XFR
	What happens if additional data is after the end of an *XFR
	Legality of serial 0
	query point in clear_query should be **
	Opcode 100 spelled wrong in host.c
	atoi -> strtol
	warning for bufsize and others out of bounds
