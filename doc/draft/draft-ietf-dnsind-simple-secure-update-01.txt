   understand and use, and flexible enough to represent any policy
   decisions.  Secure communication based on request/transaction
   signatures is used to provide authentication and authorization.

1 - Introduction

Dynamic update operations for the Domain Name System are defined in
[RFC2136], but no mechanisms for security are defined.  A form of secure
dynamic update is defined in [RFC2137, update2].  Request and
transaction signatures are defined in [TSIG] and [RFC2535].

Familiarity with the DNS system [RFC1034, RFC1035] as well as the
proposals mentioned above is assumed.

1.1 - Overview of DNS Dynamic Update

DNS dynamic update defines a new DNS opcode and a new interpretation of
the DNS message if that opcode is used.  An update can specify
insertions or deletions of data, along with prerequisites necessary for
the updates to occur.  All tests and changes for a DNS update request
are restricted to a single zone, and are performed at the primary server
for the zone.  The primary server for a dynamic zone must increment the
zone SOA serial number when an update occurs or before the next
retrieval of the SOA.

1.2 - Overview of DNS Transaction Security

Transaction signatures (TSIG [TSIG] and SIG(0) [RFC2535]) provide the
means for two processes to authenticate DNS requests and responses sent
between them.  A TSIG is generated from a shared secret, and a SIG(0) is
generated from a private key whose public counterpart is stored in DNS.
In both cases, a record containing the message signature is included as
the final resource record in a DNS message.  Keyed hashes, used in TSIG,
are simple to calculate and verify, and do not require caching of data.
Public key encryption, as used in SIG(0), is more scalable.

1.3 - Requirement of a message signature

In some cases, DNSSEC SIG records could be used to protect the integrity
of individual RRs or RRsets in the update process.  There are several
problems with this, though.  First, SIG records do not cover the message
header, so malicious tampering in the header or the removal of records
would be unnoticed.  A SIG record would be required in the zone section,
to prevent tampering.  SIG records could be created to protect data in
the prerequisite section, but this would imply that the SIG is a
prerequisite, and in some cases, the SIG may be present in DNS and
require no computation.  In the update section, signing addition

requests is straightforward, but signing delete requests is difficult,
since there may be no remaining set that a SIG would cover.

Message based signatures, using TSIG or SIG(0), avoid these problems,
since only one signature is computed for the message, and this signature
protects the integrity of the entire message.  This is also a less
expensive operation.

1.4 - Removal of non-zone key SIG records

The main objective of a DNSSEC capable resolver is the authenticated
retrieval of data.  When data is received, a chain of trust is followed
to the root.  This chain of trust must include the zone key of the zone
containing the data, but can become overly complicated if host and user
keys are delegated signing authority.  In this proposal, only signatures
generated by zone keys are considered relevant to DNSSEC capable
resolvers.  This is an update to the DNSSEC specification [RFC2535], and
simplifies the resolution process.

The primary usefulness of host and user keys, with respect to DNSSEC, is
to authenticate dynamic updates.  Thus, host and user keys may be used
to generate SIG(0) records to authenticate updates, or be used in the
TKEY [TKEY] process to generate TSIG shared secrets.  In both cases, no
SIG records generated by non-zone keys will be present in DNS.

This completely disassociates authentication of an update request from
authentication of the data itself.  Authentication of the update message
can be done with either TSIG shared secrets or DNSSEC host or user keys.
Authentication of the data, once it is present in DNS, only involves
DNSSEC zone keys.

1.5 - Signatory strength

[RFC2535] defines the signatory field of a key as the final 4 bits of
the flags field, but does not define its value.  This proposal defines
the field as a 4 bit unsigned integer representing strength, where 15 is
strongest.  A key of a certain strength can replace data signed by a key
of equal or lesser strength.  Data signed by this key can be replaced by
a key with equal or greater strength.  Note that this strength is
unrelated to the number of bits in the key.

2 - Authentication

TSIG or SIG(0) records MUST be attached to all secure dynamic update
messages.  This allows the server to verifiably determine the originator
of the message; the originator is either the other party sharing the
TSIG secret or the host or user that owns the key generating the SIG(0).
Note that SIG(0) signatures MAY NOT be generated by zone keys.

If a SIG(0) is used, the signatory strength can be derived from the
signing KEY.  If a TSIG is used that was automatically generated using
TKEY, the signatory strength of the TSIG is declared to be the same as
the KEY used in the TKEY process.  If a TSIG is used that was manually
configured, its signatory strength SHOULD be manually configured also
(or left as the default).  The key name/strength pair can be used in the
decision of whether to accept the update.

DNSSEC SIG records (other than SIG(0)) may be included in an update
message, but are not used for authentication purposes in the secure
update protocol.  If a message fails the authentication test due to an
unauthorized key, the failure is indicated with the REFUSED rcode.
Other TSIG or dynamic update errors are returned unchanged.

3 - Policy

All policy is enforced by the server and configured by the zone
administrator.  Policy checks are based on identity, where the identity
is equivalent to the owner (name) of the message signing key.  The
signing strength of the key is also important when updating a secure
zone, since the message signing key's strength can be compared to the
strength of the zone key(s).

The server's policy defines criteria which determine if the key used to
sign the update is permitted to update the records requested.  By
default, a key cannot make any changes to the zone; the key's scope must
be explicitly enabled.  There are several reasons that this process is
implemented in the server and not the protocol (as in [RFC2137,
update2], where the signatory bits of KEY records may define the
policy).

3.1 - Flexibility

Storing policy in the signatory fields of DNS keys is overly
restrictive.  Only a fixed number of bits are present, which means that
only a fixed number of policy decisions are representable.  There are
many decisions that do not fit into the framework imposed by the
signatory field; a zone administrator cannot effectively impose a policy
not implemented in the draft defining the field.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Secure Dynamic Update             June 1999

There may be any number of policies applied in the process of
authorization, and there are no restrictions on the scope of these
policies.  Implementation of the policies is beyond the scope of this
document.

3.2 - Simplicity

Policy decisions in the server could be used as an adjunct to policy
fields in the KEY records.  This could lead to confusion if the policies
are inconsistent.  Furthermore, since there is no need to expose
policies and policies need only be present at the primary server for a
zone, a central configuration point is more logical.

3.3 - Extendibility

If a policy is changed, there are no changes made to the DNS protocol or
the data on the wire.  This means that new policies can be defined at
any point without adverse effects or interoperability concerns.

3.3 - Recommendations

In many cases, dynamic updates should be restricted by name.  An example
would be that updates are allowed only if the name to be updated is
under the name of the message signing key.  Since the signatory field
defines a key's signing strength, a simple policy would only allow a key
to update signed data if the message signing key was at least as strong
as the zone key that signed the RRset.

4 - Interaction with DNSSEC

A successful update request may or may not include SIG records for each
RRset.  Since SIG records are not used for authentication in this
protocol, they are not required.  If the updated zone is signed, the
server will generate SIG records for each updated RRset with a zone key
(which MUST be online), unless the set is already correctly signed by a
zone key.  If multiple zone keys are online, the zone key with the
greatest signatory strength less than or equal to that of the update
message signing key is chosen.

If there are any immaterial (to DNSSEC) SIG records present, these are
retained.  If there are SIG records that have been generated by an
appropriate zone KEY, these SIGs are verified and retained if the
verification is successful.  DNSSEC SIG records generated by any other
KEY are dropped.  The server will also, if necessary, generate a new SOA
record and new NXT records, and sign these with a zone key.  Unlike
traditional dynamic update, the client is forbidden from updating NXT
records.  SOA updates are allowed, since SOA serial advancement policies
can be outside of the scope of the DNS protocol.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Simple Secure Dynamic Update             June 1999

Multiple zone keys can be useful in conjunction with secure dynamic
update.  A strong zone key can be used offline to sign static data,
while a weaker zone key can sign dynamic data.  If signed updates are
received with key strengths stronger than the weak zone key, updates
will be allowed only to RRsets signed by the weak zone key.  It is
highly recommended that no host or user key be allowed to have a
signatory strength equal to or greater than the strongest zone key.

5 - Security considerations

For a secure zone to support dynamic update, a zone key MUST be online
(unlike [RFC2137]).  An online zone key would be required to sign NXT
records even if other signatures were not done online, since allowing
NXT updates is inherently dangerous.
