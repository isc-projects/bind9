.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm lwresd
is the daemon providing name lookup services to clients that use
the BIND 9 lightweight resolver library.
It is essentially a stripped-down, caching-only name server that
answers queries using the BIND 9 lightweight resolver protocol
rather than the DNS protocol.
.Pp
.Nm lwresd
listens for resolver queries on a UDP port on the IPv4 loopback
interface, 127.0.0.1.
This means that
.Nm lwresd
can only be used by processes running on the local machine.
By default UDP port number 921 is used for lightweight resolver
requests and responses.
.Pp
Incoming lightweight resolver requests are decoded by
.Nm lwresd
which then resolves them using the DNS protocol.
When the DNS lookup completes,
.Nm lwresd
encodes the answers from the name servers in the lightweight
resolver format and returns them to the client that made the original
request.
.Pp
If
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
contains any
.Sy nameserver
entries,
.Nm lwresd
sends recursive DNS queries to those servers.  This
is similar to the use of forwarders in a chaching name
server.  If no
.Sy nameserver
entries are  present, or if forwarding fails,
.Nm lwresd
resolves the queries autonomously starting at the
root name servers, using a compiled-in list of root
servers hints.
.Pp
The options to
.Nm lwresd
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
use
.Ar config-file
as the configuration file instead of the default,
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf .
.It Fl d
set the daemon's debug level to
.Ar debuglevel .
Debugging traces from
.Nm lwresd
become more verbose as the debug level increases.
.It Fl f
run
.Nm lwresd
in the foreground.
.It Fl g
run
.Nm lwresd
in the foreground and force all logging to
.Dv stderr .
.It Fl i
write the daemon's process id to
.Ar pid-file
instead of the default pathname.
.It Fl n
create
.Ar #cpus
worker threads to take advantage of multiple CPUs.
If no option is given,
.Nm lwresd
will try to determine the number of CPUs present and create
one thread per CPU.  If
.Nm lwresd
is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a single worker thread
is created.
.It Fl P
send DNS lookups to port number
.Ar query-port#
when querying name servers.
This provides a way of testing the lightweight resolver daemon with a
name server that listens for queries on a non-standard port number.
.It Fl p
listen for lightweight resolver queries on the loopback interface
using UDP port
.Ar port#
instead of the default port number, 921.
.It Fl s
write memory usage statistics to
.Dv stdout
on exit.
This option is only of interest to BIND 9 developers and may be
removed or changed in a future release.
.It Fl t
tells
.Nm lwresd
to chroot() to
.Ar directory
immediately after reading its configuration file.
.It Fl u
run
.Nm lwresd
as
.Ar user-id ,
which is a user name or numeric id that must be present in the
password file.
The lightweight resolver daemon will change its user-id after it has
carried out any privileged operations, such as writing the process-id
file or binding a socket to a privileged port (typically any port
less than 1024).

.Sh NOTES
.Nm lwresd
is a daemon for lightweight resolvers, not a lightweight daemon
for resolvers.
