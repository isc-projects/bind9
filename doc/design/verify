	dnssec-verify a tool to verify a zone is correctly signed.

* check that every record that should be signed has a valid RRSIG set.
* check that every record that shouldn't be signed isn't.
* check that each RRSIG set has a valid RRSIG and that all DNSKEY algorithms
	in use are checked.
* provide a mechanism to mark DNSKEY algorithms to be ignored to support
	verification of zones that are in the process of adding/removing
	support for a algorithm.
* provide a mechanism to check the zone as of a specified date and time.
* check that RRSIG won't expire within the TTL interval.
* check that original TTL matches.

NSEC:
* check that every node with data within the zone has a NSEC RRset.
* check that empty nodes don't have a NSEC record.
* check that nodes outside the zone do not have a NSEC record.
* check that the NSEC chain is valid.

NSEC3: for each NSEC3 chain
* check that every node with data within the zone has a NSEC3 RRset.
* check that empty nodes within the zone have a NSEC3 record.
* check that nodes outside the zone do not have a NSEC3 record.
* check that each NSEC3 in the NSEC3PARAM record is valid.
