			Zones

Overview

	Zones are the unit of delegation in the DNS and may go from holding
	RR's only at the zone top to holding the complete hierarchy (private
	roots zones).  Zones have an associated database which is the
	container for the RR sets that make up the zone.

	Zone have certain properties associated with them.

	* name
	* class
	* master / slave / stub / hint / cache / forward
	* serial number
	* signed / unsigned
	* update periods (refresh / retry) (slave / stub)
	* last update time (slave / stub)
	* access restrictions
	* transfer restrictions (master / slave)
	* update restictions (master / slave)
	* expire period (slave / stub)
	* children => bottom
	* glue
	* rrsets / data
	* transfer "in" in progress
	* transfers "out" in progress
	* "current" check in progress
	* our masters
	* primary master name (required to auto generate our masters)
	* master file name
	* database name
	* database type
		* initially only master_file (BIND 4 & 8)
		* expanded axfr + ixfr
	* transaction logs
	* notification lists
		* NS's
		* static additional sites (stealth servers)
		* dynamically learned sites (soa queries)

	Zones have two types of versions associated with them.

	Type 1.
		The image of the "current" zone when a AXFR out is in progress.
		There may be several of these at once but they cease to need
		to exist once the AXFR's on this version has completed. These
		are maintained by the various database access methods.

	Type 2.
		These are virtual versions of the zone and are required to
		support IXFR requests.  While the entire contents of the old
		version does not need to be kept, a change log needs to be
		kept.  An index into this log would be useful in speeding
		up replies. These versions have an explicit expiry date.

		"How long are we going to keep them operationally?"
                While there are expriry dates based on last update /
                change time + expire.  In practice holding the deltas
                for a few refresh periods should be enough.  If the network
                and servers are up one is enough.

		"How are we going to generate them from a master file?"
                UPDATE should not be the only answer to this question.
                We need a tool that takes the current zone & new zone.
                Verifies the new zone, generates a delta and feeds this
                at named.  It could well be part of ndc but does not have
                to be.


	Zones need to have certain operations performed on them. The need to
	be:

	* loaded
	* unloaded
	* dumped
	* updated (UPDATE / IXFR)
	* copied out in full (AXFR) or as partial deltas (IXFR)
	* read from
	* validated
	* generate a delta between two given versions.
	* signed / resigned
	* maintenance
		validate current soa
		remove old deltas / consolidation
		purge stale rrsets (cache)
	* notification
		responding to
		generating

	While not strictly a nameserver function, bad delegation and bad
	slave setups are continual and ongoing sources of problems in the
	DNS.  Periodic checks to ensure parent and child servers agree on
	the list of nameservers and that slaves are tracking the changes
	made in the master server's zone will allow problems in
	configurations to be identified earlier providing for a more stable
	DNS.

Compatibility:

	Zones are required to be configuration file compatible with
	BIND 8.x.
