 |-lists of dead handles
 ...

A handle contains a task, taskaction, and event argument, and is linkable
in two ways.  One, for the list returned to the caller, and two to be
attached to either a name (so events can be generated) or to the dead handle
list, where no events are generated.

Notes and questions:

	o If a handle is on the dead handle list, it is only waiting for
	  the caller to dns_adb_done() it.

	o If a handle is on a name list, it will generate at most one
	  event, and then be moved to the dead handle list.

	o If events are not requested, it is NEVER placed on the name's
	  list, even though fetches for that name may be started.

	o Names will have to have a reference count for each fetch
	  in progress.  They will also have a bit that says some
	  previous fetches failed.  XXX How in the world would I
	  "refresh" the data?  If I only got 2 of 9 A6 chains to converge,
	  when and how do I restart them later?

	o The caller will give us a name, and we will return two items:
	  a handle and a list of addresses.  If the list was non-empty when
	  it was given to us, we will append (unique) addrinfo's to the list.

	o How in the world do you shut this thing down?
		If you cancel the fetches first:
			1.  The handles are sent an event saying "no more
			    names are coming."
			2.  The handles are moved to the dead handle list.

		If you cancel the handles first:
			1.  The handles are moved to the dead handle list.

	  It would therefore seem simpler to cancel/done all handles first,
	  then all fetches.

	o If a fetch returns a CNAME, what do we do?

	o If a fetch returns a DNAME, what do we do?

	o If a fetch returns 4 ipv4 addresses, we will have to allocate
	  3 more (total of 4) namehooks, 4 entries, and fill them in.
	  What happens if only some of these can be allocated?

	o ipv6 raises the memory problem to a new level.  What if we
	  have to fork into multiple chains, but we run out of memory?


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking up entries via names:

	Look for the name in the database.

	FOUND:
		For each complete address, allocate an addrinfo structure
		and add it to the handle.

		If any fetches are in progress for this name, attach this
		handle to this name so events can be posted to the handle,
		if the handle wants events.

		If no fetches are in progress and the name is incomplete,
		see if we can start a fetch for this name.

	NOT FOUND:
		Create a new adbname structure.

		Create a new namehook structure.

		Start a fetch on this name.

	If more data is coming (fetches are in progress) attach
	the handle to the name, so it can get notification of
	new data.

	If the name is incomplete (due to fetches in progress,
	recently failed fetches, or the inability to start new
	fetches) copy the incomplete flag to the handle, so the
	caller can know this.
