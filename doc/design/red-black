                 Red-Black Tree Implementation Notes

OVERVIEW

BIND9's basic name storage mechanism is to use a modified form of
balanced binary tree known as a red-black tree.  Red-black trees
provide for relatively efficient storage, retrieval and removal of
data while maintaining the lexical order of all stored keys, a
necessary function for DNS security.

DESCRIPTION

A red-black tree is a balanced binary tree named for the coloring that
is done in the tree, identifying each node as either red or black.
There are two simple rules for maintaining the color of nodes:
  (1) A red node has only black children.
  (2) The path from the root to any leaf node always includes the
      same number of black nodes.

Whenever a key is added or removed, adjustments are made to adhere to
those two rules.  These adjustments are relatively cheap to make but
maintain the balance of the tree, thus making for efficient addition,
lookup and deletion operations, all of which are O(log N).  The color
of a node is not relevant to external users of the tree; it is needed
only to maintain the balance of the tree.

For more information on basic red-black trees, see _Introduction to
Algorithms_, Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, MIT Press / McGraw Hill,
1990, ISBN 0-262-03141-8, chapter 14.

In BIND9, the red-black tree implementation uses DNS names as keys,
and can store arbitrary data with each key value.  "name" and "key"
are used interchangeably in this document.

The basic red-black tree algorithm is further adapted for use in BIND9
to incorporate the notion of hierarchy, creating a tree of red-black
trees.  Where there is more than one name with a common suffix, all
names with that suffix are stored in their own red-black tree, with a
down pointer from the suffix locating the subtree.

For example, consider storing the following names:
   a       x.d.e.f     o.w.y.d.e.f
   b       z.d.e.f     p.w.y.d.e.f
   c       g.h         q.w.y.d.e.f

No matter which order the keys were added, this would result in a tree
that can be visualized as:

                                b
                              /   \
                             a    d.e.f
                                   /|\
                                  c | g.h
                                    |
                                   w.y
                                   /|\
                                  x | z
                                    |
                                    p
                                   / \
                                  o   q

This tree shows that when there is no key for a particular label, and
when there is only one known label for its immediate subordinate, then
multiple labels can appear in a single node, such as at d.e.f and g.h.
It also demonstrates that there can be more nodes in the tree of trees
than there are actual keys (which degrades the O(log N) performance
marginally); the nodes at d.e.f and w.y do not represent keys.

As an aside, remember that when ordering DNS names, labels are
examined from the right, therefore w.y sorts after x and before z.

A split can occur not only on a regular label boundary, but also
between any two bits in an EDNS bitstring label.  The common-suffix
rules will be applied to keep as many bits together as possible.

In the current implementation of the tree of trees, a node is
considered to "formally" exist only if it has data associated with
it.  So if the above tree then had the key d.e.f added to it, the
operation would succeed rather than getting an "already exists"
error.

Along the same lines, if a key is added with a name which is a proper
superdomain of the name stored in an existing node, the operation will
succeed by splitting the existing node into one node that is the key
and another node that is the remaining parts of the name.  Adding e.f
to the above tree results in the top level red-black tree having a
node named e.f where the current d.e.f is, and a down pointer from
d.e.f to a "tree" of a single node named d.  The down pointer from d
would be kept to the level which has x, w.y, and z.

A similar split of d.e.f would occur if the name k.e.f were added.
The top level tree would have the node e.f with a down pointer to a
level that had both d and k, and d would continue to have its down
pointer to the x, w.y and z level.

It is guaranteed when splitting that external references to the node
that is split will remain valid --- in the previous examples, anything
that was pointing to the node that was d.e.f will still point to the
node that is now just d.

When deleting keys, nodes can be rejoined.  If both of p.w.y.d.e.f and
q.w.y.d.e.f were removed from the example tree, the node named w.y
would become o.w.y.  Unlike splitting, it is _not_ guaranteed that
external references remain consistent; sometimes they will, sometimes
they won't.  Also, note that deletion is not perfectly symmetric with
addition.  If you "undo" the last addition with a deletion of the same
key then the tree of trees is not guaranteed to have exactly the same
structure as it had prior to the addition.  Sometimes, but not always.

Rejoining does not happen if it would violate any of the rules that
cause a split.  o would not be rejoined with w.y if w.y had data
associated with the key; o would remain as a single node on its own
level.  This emphasizes the rule that a node is considered to formally
exist only if data is associated with it, because even if w.y.d.e.f
had been explicitly added as a key but with no data, then o would
still be merged with the w.y node when p and q were deleted.

Searching for a node generally returns one of three possible results:
either the key is found, a superdomain (partial match) of the key is
found, or no part of the key is found.  The first and last are rather
obvious, and the second result basically means that a hierarchically
enclosing name is found; e.g, searching for bb.rc.vix.com turned up
rc.vix.com, but not the full name.

No locking is done within the RBT library.  @@@

CHAINS

@@@

When a partial match is made, level_matches is set while the chain
points to the partial match node that was found.  Then the chain is
adjusted to point to the DNSSEC predecessor node, which might not even
be under the same top level domain as the name that was searched for.
For example, consider a database that had only the names vix.com and
isc.org.  A search for uu.net would leave the chain pointed to
vix.com, the DNSSEC predecessor.  Though this might first appear to
cause level_matches to be bogus because the chain has been unwound and
sent down another path, note that the partial match node will always
be in the chain of the predecessor, too --- and often the partial
match node will be the predecessor itself.  In the vix.com/isc.org
example, the search for uu.net finds a partial match at ".", which is
of course also in the path to the vix.com predecessor.  A search for
www.isc.org would find that isc.org is both the partial match and the
predecessor.

EXTERNAL PROGRAMMATIC DETAILS

This section details the functions used to interact with the BIND9
red-black tree library, or RBT for short.

A source file that will be using RBT will usually need to include
<dns/rbt.h>.  This header file automatically includes <isc/result.h),
<isc/mem.h>, <dns/types.h>, and <dns/name.h>.

The rbt.h file has more complete descriptions of each of the functions
named here, including what is required for each argument, what each
function ensures (and might not ensure) will occur, and the full range
of possible results for each call.  Note well: if a function returns a
dns_result_t rather than void, it definitely means there is something
that can go possibly wrong in the function and it should be checked by
the caller.

A new tree of trees must be initialized using:

  dns_result_t dns_rbt_create(isc_mem_t *mctx, void (*deleter)(void *, void *),
                              void *deleter_arg, dns_rbt_t **rbtp);

The memory context, mctx, must be a non-null pointer that was
initialized with isc_mem_create().  The deleter argument, if non-null,
should point to a function that is responsible for cleaning up any
memory associated with the data pointer of a node when the node is
deleted.  It is passed the deleted node's data pointer as its first
argument and deleter_arg as its second argument.

After initializing an RBT manager, to add keys to the tree, use:

  dns_result_t dns_rbt_addname(dns_rbt_t *rbt, dns_name_t *name, void *data);

The name _must_ be an absolute name.  It is not required that the data
pointer be non-null, but it is recommended that it point to something,
even just invalid memory, because of the various searching and
deletion issues described in the previous section.  The RBT code will
not attempt to dereference the pointer.

To find a key in the tree, use:

  dns_result_t dns_rbt_findname(dns_rbt_t *rbt, dns_name_t *name, void **data);

The data parameter must not be NULL, but *data must be NULL.  The
result will be either DNS_R_SUCCESS, DNS_R_PARTIALMATCH or
DNS_R_NOTFOUND.  In the first case, an exact match was found for the
name and there was an associate data pointer, which is returned via
the data parameter.  A partial match results when the name has not
been found but a superdomain name, with data, does exist; then the
data for that name is returned in the data parameter.  If no data is
found for the name or a superdomain, *data will remain NULL.


INTERNAL PROGRAMMATIC DETAILS

This section is mainly relevant to the RBT DB implementation.  It is
highly recommended that programmers using the RBT library stick to the
functions named in the previous section.

The dns_rbt_addname and dns_rbt_findname functions named in the
previous section are wrappers around dns_rbt_addnode and
dns_rbt_findnode.  The *node functions for the most part do not
particularly care whether a node has an associated data pointer or
not, whereas the *name functions do.  The one exception to this is
that when a PARTIALMATCH is returned for a search, the indicated node
is the deepest match that has data, rather than just the deepest
match.  Even that behavior is selectable, however, using the boolean
empty_data_ok argument to dns_rbt_findnode.

Each node in the tree of trees is represented by the following structure:

  typedef struct dns_rbtnode {
          struct dns_rbtnode *left;
          struct dns_rbtnode *right;
          struct dns_rbtnode *down;
          /*
           * The following bitfields add up to a total bitwidth of 32.
           * The range of values necessary for each item is indicated,
           * but in the case of "attributes" the field is wider to accommodate
           * possible future expansion.  "offsetlen" could be one bit
           * narrower by always adjusting its value by 1 to find the real
           * offsetlen, but doing so does not gain anything (except perhaps
           * another bit for "attributes", which doesn't yet need any more).
           */
          unsigned int color:1;	     /* range is 0..1 */
          unsigned int attributes:6; /* range is 0..2 */
          unsigned int namelen:8;    /* range is 1..255 */
          unsigned int offsetlen:8;  /* range is 1..128 */
          unsigned int padbytes:9;   /* range is 0..380 */
          /*
           * These values are used in the RBT DB implementation.  The
           * appropriate node lock must be held before accessing them.
           */
          void *data;
          unsigned int dirty:1;
          unsigned int locknum:DNS_RBT_LOCKLENGTH;
          unsigned int references:DNS_RBT_REFLENGTH;
  } dns_rbtnode_t;
