	  CDS / CDNSKEY Child side processing.

* We need a mechanism to say that key should have a cds publish
  start/end dates.

* We need a mechanism to say that key should have a cdnskey publish
  start/end dates

  - update dnssec-settime, dnssec-keygen, dnssec-keyfromlabel
  - update K* files

* dnssec-signzone should add cds and/or cdnskey to zone apex iff the
  DNSKEY is published and is signing the DNSKEY RRset.  CDS and CDNSKEY
  records are only removed if there is a deletion date set (implicit on
  matching DNSKEY going inactive / unpublished or explicit).

  Non-matching CDS and CDNSKEY are removed.

* auto-dnssec maintain should cds and/or cdnskey to zone apex iff the 
  DNSKEY is published and is signing the DNSKEY RRset.   CDS and CDNSKEY
  records are only removed if there is a deletion date set (implicit on
  matching DNSKEY going inactive / unpublished or explicit).

* UPDATE should check that CDS and CDNSKEY match a active DNSKEY that
  is signing the DNSKEY RRset and ignore otherwise.  This should be
  done after all the update section records have been processed.

  ? how will this tie in with CDS/CDNSKEY sanity checks?  Only on fail?

* UPDATE should remove CDS and CDNSKEY records that match a DNSKEY
  that is being removed. This should be done after all the update
  section records have been processed.

  ? how will this tie in with CDS/CDNSKEY sanity checks?  Only on fail?

* Zone loading should perform sanity checks on CDS and CDNSKEY
  records against the DNSKEY records.  This will flow through into
  dnssec-checkzone and "dnssec-checkconf -z".  ignore/warn/fail

* rndc add the ability to say generate CDS / CDNSKEY along with a key list /
  all / all SEP

* rndc add the ability to say remove CDS / CDNSKEY.

* inline zones need to check CDS and CDNSKEY records in the raw zone and
  filter non matching.

* CDS and CDNSKEY must be signed by a DNSKEY which matches parent DS record.
  This is is different to how non DNSKEY RRsets are usually signed
  RFC 7344, 4.1.
