        rndc keydone <rdata> zone [class [view]]

        e.g.
                rndc keydone 0549E00001 example

        Last 4 characters need to be 0001 (00=no flags, 01=done)
        First 2 characters (algorithm) not 00 (algorithm 0 which
        is reserved, 00 => NSEC3PARAMETERS are encoded in the record)
        All hexadecimal case insensitive.  length 10.
                Err: DNS_R_SYNTAX

                Err: DNS_R_NOTFOUND

        zone must be a primary (signed inline == primary) or normal
        dynamic zone.
                Err: DNS_R_NOTPRIMARY

        dns_zone_<something>(zone, text) which will send a event
        to the zone so that the deletion gets run in the zone's
        task.  The event handler will delete the record, update the
        SOA and write out the journal.
                Err: ISC_R_NOMEMORY
