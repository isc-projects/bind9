<H2>C Language</H2>

An ANSI standard C compiler and library are assumed.  Feel free to use any
ANSI C feature.<P>

<H2>Warnings</H2>
Given a reasonable set of things to warn about (e.g. -W -Wall for gcc), the
goal is to compile with no warnings.

<H2>C Source Code</H2>

<H3>Copyright</H3>

All source files should have a copyright.  The copyright year(s)
should be kept current.  The files and the copyright year(s) should be
listed in util/copyrights.<P>

<H3>Line Formatting</H3>
<H4>Indentation</H4>
Use tabs.  Spaces are only allowed when needed to line up a continued
expression.  In the following example, spaces used for indentation are
indicated with "_":
<PRE><CODE>
	printf("this is going to be %s very long %s statement\n",
	_______"a", "printf");
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Vertical Whitespace</H4>
Vertical whitespace is also encouraged for improved code legibility by
grouping closely related statements and then separating them with a
single empty line.  There should not, however, be more than one empty
adjacent line anywhere.

<H4>Line Length</H4>
Lines should not be longer than 79 characters, even if it requires
violating the indentation rules to do so.  Since ANSI is assumed, the
best way to deal with strings that extend past column 79 is to break
them into two or more sections separated from each other by a newline
and indentation:

<PRE><CODE>
        			  puts("This string got very far to the "
                                       "left and wrapped.  ANSI catenation "
                                       "rules will turn this into one "
                                       "long string.");
</CODE></PRE>

<H3>Comments</H3>
Comments should be used anytime they improve the readability of the code.<P>

Comments may be single-line or multiline.  A single-line comment should be
at the end of the line if there is other text on the line, and should start
in the same column as other nearby end-of-line comments. The comment
should be at the same indentation level as the text it is referring to.
Multiline comments should start with "/*" on a line by itself.  Subsequent
lines should have " *" lined-up with the "*" above.  The end of the comment
should be " */" on a line by itself, again with the "*" lined-up with the
one above.  Comments should start with a capital letter and end with a
period.<P>
Good:<P>
<PRE><CODE>
	/*
	 * Private variables.
	 */

	static int		a		/* Description of 'a'. */
	static int		b		/* Description of 'b'. */
	static char *		c		/* Description of 'c'. */
</CODE></PRE>

The following lint and lint-like comments should be used where appropriate:
<PRE><CODE>
	/* ARGSUSED */
	/* FALLTHROUGH */
	/* NOTREACHED */
	/* VARARGS */
</CODE></PRE>

<H3>.h files</H3>
.h files should not rely on other files having been included.  .h
files should prevent multiple inclusion.  The OS is assumed to prevent
multiple inclusion of its .h files.<P>
.h files that define modules should have a structure like the
following.  Note that <isc/lang.h> should be included by any public
header file to get the ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS and ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS
macros used so the correct name-mangling happens for function
declarations when C++ programs include the file. <isc/lang.h> should
be included for private header files or for public files that do not
declare any functions.<P>

<H3>C Source</H3>
<H4>Including Interfaces (.h files)</H4>
The first file to be included in a C source file must be config.h.
The config.h file must never be included by any public header file
(that is, any header file that will be installed by "make install").
Try to include only necessary files, not everything under the sun.<P>
Operating-system-specific files should not be included by most modules.<P>
Include UNIX "sys" .h files before ordinary C includes.<P>

<H4>Statements</H4>
There should be at most one statement per line.  The comma operator
should not be used to form compound statements.<P>
Bad:<P>
<PRE><CODE>
	if (i > 0) {
		printf("yes\n"); i = 0; j = 0;
                x = 4, y *= 2;
	}
</CODE></PRE>
<H4>Functions</H4>
The use of ANSI C function prototypes is required.<P>
The return type of the function should be listed on a line by itself when
specifying the implementation of the function.  The opening curly brace should
occur on the same line as the argument list, unless the argument list is
more than one line long.<P>
Good:<P>
<PRE><CODE>
static inline void
f(int i) {
	/* whatever */
}

int
g(int i, /* other args here */
  int last_argument)
{
	return (i * i);
}
</CODE></PRE>

To suppress compiler warnings, unused function arguments are declared
using the <CODE>UNUSED()</CODE> macro.<P>

In the function body, local variable declarations are followed by any
<CODE>REQUIRE()</CODE>s, <CODE>UNUSED()</CODE> declarations, and other
code, in this order.  These sections are separated by blank lines.<P>

<H4>Curly Braces</H4>
Curly Braces do not get their own indentation.
An opening brace does not start a new line.  The statements enclosed
by the braces should not be on the same line as the opening or closing
brace.  A closing brace should be the only thing on the line, unless
it's part of an else clause.<P>

Generally speaking, when a control statement (<CODE>if, for</CODE> or
<CODE>while</CODE>) has only a single action associated with it, then no
bracing is used around the statement.  Exceptions include when the
compiler would complain about an ambiguous else clause, or when extra
bracing improves the readability (a judgement call biased toward not
having the braces).<P>

Good:<P>
<PRE><CODE>
static void
f(int i) {
	if (i > 0) {
		printf("yes\n");
		i = 0;
	} else
		printf("no\n");
}
</CODE></PRE>
Bad:<P>
<PRE><CODE>
void f(int i)
  {
    if(i<0){i=0;printf("was negative\n");}
    if (i > 0)
      {
        printf("yes\n");
        i = 0;
      }}
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Spaces</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Do put a space between operators like '=', '+', '==', etc.
<LI>Do put a space after ','.
<LI>Do put a space after ';' in a 'for' statement.
<LI>Do put a space after 'return', and also parenthesize the return value.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Do not put a space between a variable or function name and '(' or '['.
<LI>Do not put a space after the "sizeof" operator name, and also
parenthesize its argument, as in <CODE>malloc(4 * sizeof(long))</CODE>.
<LI>Do not put a space immediately after a '(' or immediately before a ')',
unless it improves readability.  The same goes for '[' and ']'.
<LI>Do not put a space before '++' or '--' when used in
post-increment/decrement mode, or after them when used in
pre-increment/decrement mode.
<LI>Do not put a space before ';' when terminating a statement or in a 'for'
statement.
<LI>Do not put a space after '*' when used to dereference a pointer, or on
either side of '->'.
<LI>Do not put a space after '~'.
<LI>The '|' operator may either have a space on both sides or it may have no
spaces.
<LI>Do not put a space after a cast.
</UL>

<H4>Return Values</H4>
If a function returns a value, it should be cast to (void) if you don't
care what the value is, except for <CODE>printf</CODE> and its variants,
<CODE>fputc</CODE>, <CODE>fwrite</CODE> (when writing text),
<CODE>fflush</CODE>,
<CODE>memcpy</CODE>, <CODE>memmove</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE>, 
<CODE>strcpy</CODE>, <CODE>strncpy</CODE>, and <CODE>strcat</CODE>.
<P>

Certain functions return values or not depending on the operating
system or even compiler flags; these include 
these include <CODE>openlog</CODE> and <CODE>srandom</CODE>.
The return value of these should not be used nor cast to (void).
<P>

All error conditions must be handled.<P>

Mixing of error status and valid results within a single type should be
avoided.<P>
Good:
<PRE><CODE>
	os_descriptor_t		s;
	os_result_t		result;

	result = os_socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0, &s);
	if (result != OS_R_SUCCESS) {
		/* Do something about the error. */
		return;
	}
</CODE></PRE>
Not so good:
<PRE><CODE>
	int s;

	/*
	 * Obviously using interfaces like socket() (below) is allowed
	 * since otherwise you couldn't call operating system routines; the
	 * point is not to write more interfaces like them.
	 */
	s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
	if (s < 0) {
		/* Do something about the error using errno. */
		return;
	}
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Integral Types</H4>
Careful thought should be given to whether an integral type should be
signed or unsigned, and to whether a specific size is required.  "int"
should be used for generic variables (e.g. iteration counters, array
subscripts).  Other than for generic variables, if a negative value isn't
meaningful, the variable should be unsigned.  Assignments and
comparisons between signed and unsigned integers should be avoided;
suppressing the warnings with casts is not desireable.<P>

<H4>Casting</H4>
Casting should be avoided when possible.  When it is necessary, there
should be no space between the cast and what is being cast.<P>

Bad (obviously for more than one reason ...):
<PRE><CODE>
	(void) malloc(SMBUF);
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Clear Success or Failure</H4>
A function should report success or failure, and do so accurately.  It
should never fail silently.  Use of Design by Contract can help here.<P>

When a function is designed to return results to the caller by
assigning to caller variables through pointer arguments, it should
perform the assignment only if it succeeds and leave the variables
unmodified if it fails.<P>

<H4>Testing Bits</H4>
Bit testing should be as follows:<P>
Good:
<PRE><CODE>
	/* Test if flag set. */
	if ((flags & FOO) != 0) {

	}
	/* Test if flag clear. */
	if ((flags & BAR) == 0) {

	}
	/* Test if both flags set. */
	if ((flags & (FOO|BAR)) == (FOO|BAR)) {

	}
</CODE></PRE>
Bad:
<PRE><CODE>
	/* Test if flag set. */
	if (flags & FOO) {

	}
	/* Test if flag clear. */
	if (! (flags & BAR)) {

	}
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Pointers</H4>
<H5>Null Pointer</H5>
The null pointer value should be referred to with "NULL", not with "0".
Testing to see whether a pointer is NULL should be explicit.<P>
Good:
<PRE><CODE>
	char *c = NULL;

	/* ... */

	if (c == NULL) {
		/* Do something. */
	}
</CODE></PRE>

<H5>Invalidating Pointers</H5>
When the data a pointer points to has been freed, or is otherwise no longer
valid, the pointer should be set to NULL unless the pointer is part of a
structure which is itself going to be freed immediately.<P>
Good:
<PRE><CODE>
	char *text;

	/* text is initialized here. */

	free(text);
	text = NULL;
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Testing for Zero or Non-zero</H4>
Explicit testing against zero is required for numeric, non-boolean variables.
<P>
Good:
<PRE><CODE>
	int i = 10;

	/* ... */

	if (i != 0) {
		/* Do something. */
	}
</CODE></PRE>
Bad:
<PRE><CODE>
	int i = 10;

	/* ... */

	if (i) {
		/* Do something. */
	}
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>The Ternary Operator</H4>
The ?: operator should mostly be avoided.  It is tolerated when
deciding what value to pass as a parameter to a function, such as
frequently happens with printf, and also when a simple (non-compound)
value is being used in assignment or as part of a calculation.
In particular, using the ternary operator to specify a return value is
verboten.<P>

Good:
<PRE><CODE>
	printf("%c is%s a number.\n", c, isdigit(c) ? "" " NOT");
        l = (l1 < l2) ? l1 : l2;
        if (gp.length + (go < 16384 ? 2 : 3) >= name->length) {
           ...
        }
</CODE></PRE>

Bad:
<PRE><CODE>
	return (success ? ISC_R_SUCESS : ISC_R_FAILURE);
</CODE></PRE>

<H4>Assignment in Parameters</H4>
Variables should not have their values assigned or changed when being
passed as parameters, except perhaps for the increment and decrement
operators.<P>

Bad:
<PRE><CODE>
	malloc(size = 20);
</CODE></PRE>

Ok:
<PRE><CODE>
	fputc(c++, stdout);
</CODE></PRE>

<H3>Namespace</H3>
<H4>Public Interfaces</H4>
All public interfaces to functions, macros, typedefs, and
variables provided by the library, should use names of the form
{library}_{module}_{what}, such as:
<PRE><CODE>
	isc_buffer_t				/* typedef */
        dns_name_setbuffer(name, buffer)	/* function */
        ISC_LIST_HEAD(list)			/* macro */
        isc_commandline_argument		/* variable */
</CODE></PRE>
however, structures which are typedef'd generally have the name of the
typedef sans the final _t:
<PRE><CODE>
	struct dns_rbtnode {
        	/* ... members ... */
	}
</CODE></PRE>
Generally speaking macros are defined with all capital letters, but
this is not universally consistent (eg, numerous isc_buffer_{foo}
macros).<P>
The {module} and {what} segments of the name do not have underscores
separating natural word elements, as demonstrated in
isc_commandline_argument and dns_name_setbuffer above.  The {module}
part is usually the same as the basename of the source file, but
sometimes other {module} interfaces appear within one file, such as
dns_label_* interfaces in lib/dns/name.c.  However, in the public
libraries the file name must be the same as some module interface
provided by the file; e.g., dns_rbt_* interfaces would not be declared
in a file named redblack.c (in lieu of any other dns_redblack_*
interfaces in the file).<P>

The one notable exception to this naming rule is the interfaces
provided by <isc/util.h>.  There's a large caveat associated with the
public description of this file that it is hazardous to use because it
pollutes the general namespace.<P>

<H4>Shared Private Interfaces</H4>
When a module provides an interface for internal use by other modules
in the library, it should use the same naming convention
described for the public interfaces, except {library} and {module}
are separated by a double-underscore.  This indicates that the name is
internal, its API is not as formal as the public API, and thus it
might change without any sort of notice.

<H3>Initialization</H3>
When an object is allocated from the heap, all fields in the object must be
initialized.<P>

<H3>Dead Code Pruning</H3>
Source which becomes obsolete should be removed, not just disabled with
#if 0 ... #endif.<P>

<H3>Log messages</H3>

Error and warning messages should be logged through the logging
system.  Debugging printfs may be used during development, but
must be removed when the debugging is finished.  The
<CODE>UNEXPECTED_ERROR()</CODE> macro is obsolete and
should not be used in new code.<P>

Log messages do not start with a capital letter, nor do they end
in a period.<P>

When variable text such as a file name or domain name occurs
as part of an English phrase, it should be enclosed in single
quotes, as in <CODE>"zone '%s' is lame"</CODE>.<P>

When the variable text forms a separate phrase, such as when it
separated from the rest of the message by a colon, it can be left
unquoted.  E.g., <CODE>isc_log_write(... "open: %s: %s", filename,
isc_result_totext(result));</CODE><P>

Function names, line numbers, memory addresses, and other references
to program internals may be used in debugging messages and in
messages to report programming errors detected at runtime.
They may not be used in messages that indicate errors in the
program's inputs or operation.<P>

<H2>Perl source code</H2>

Perl must not be required for building, installing, or using the BIND 9
name server.  It may be used for things like test scripts and optional
server add-on components.<P>

Perl 5 is assumed; Perl scripts do not need to work in Perl 4.<P>

Perl source code should follow the conventions for C source code
where applicable.<P>
