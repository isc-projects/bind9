## BIND 9 Coding Style

BIND 9 is principally written in [C](#cstyle), with some additional code
written in [Python](#pystyle), [Perl](#plstyle) and
[Bourne shell](#shstyle).  Style guidelines for each of these are
below.

### <a name="cstyle"></a>C

#### Compiler

An ANSI standard C compiler and library are assumed.  Feel free to use any
ANSI C feature.

#### Warnings

Given a reasonable set of things to warn about (e.g. -W -Wall for gcc), the
goal is to compile with no warnings.

#### Copyright Notices

All source files should have a copyright.  The copyright year(s) should be
kept current.  The files and the copyright year(s) should be listed in
util/copyrights.  When an existing file is updated in the source
repository, its copyright notice and dates are updated automatically.

#### Line Formatting

Use tabs for indentation.  Spaces before statements are only allowed when
needed to line up a continued expression.  In the following example, spaces
used for indentation are indicated with `"_"`:

        if (i == 0) {
                printf("this is going to be %s very long %s statement\\n",
                _______"a", "printf");
        }

Text editors should be configured with tabstop set to 8 characters, and
tabs should not be expanded to into spaces.  The following `vim` settings
conform well to BIND 9 C style:

        set showmatch
        set showmode
        set autoindent
        set expandtab

        filetype plugin on
        let c_syntax_for_h = 1
        autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp set cindent
        autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp set cino=(0:0l1
        autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp set fo=rotcq
        autocmd FileType c,cc,cpp set noexpandtab ts=8
        autocmd FileType python set ts=4 sw=4
        
        filetype indent on

#### Vertical Whitespace

Vertical whitespace is encouraged for improved code legibility: closely
related statements should be grouped, and then the groups separated with a
single empty line.  There should never be two or more empty lines adjacent
to one another.

#### Line Length

Lines should be no longer than 79 characters, even if it requires violating
indentation rules to make them fit.  Since ANSI C is assumed, the best way to
deal with strings that extend past column 79 is to break them into two or
more sections separated from each other by a newline and indentation:

                                  puts("This string got very far to the "
                                       "right and wrapped.  ANSI catenation "
                                       "rules will turn this into one "
                                       "long string.");

#### Comments

Comments should be used whenever they improve the readability or
comprehensibility of the code.  Comments describing public functions are
usually in the header file below the function prototype; comments
describing static functions are above the function declaration.

Comments may be single-line or multiline.  A single-line comment should be
at the end of the line if there is other text on the line, and should start
in the same column as other nearby end-of-line comments.  The comment
should be at the same indentation level as the code it is referring to.

Multiline comments should start with `"/*"` on a line by itself.
Subsequent lines should have `" *"` lined-up with the `"*"` above.  The end of
the comment should be `" */"` on a line by itself, again with the `"*"`
lined-up with the one above.  Comments should start with a capital letter
and end with a period.

Good:

        /*
         * Private variables.
         */
 
        static int              a               /* Description of 'a'. */
        static int              b               /* Description of 'b'. */
        static char *           c               /* Description of 'c'. */


The following lint and lint-like comments should be used where appropriate:

    	/* ARGSUSED */
    	/* FALLTHROUGH */
    	/* NOTREACHED */
    	/* VARARGS */

#### Header files

.h files should not rely on other files having been included.  .h files
should prevent multiple inclusion.  The OS is assumed to prevent multiple
inclusion of its .h files.

A header file defining a public interface is generally placed in the source
tree two levels below the C file that implements the interface.  For
example, the include file defining the interface for `lib/dns/zone.c` is in
`lib/dns/include/dns/zone.h`.  (The second "dns" in the path enables the file
to be included via `"#include <dns/zone.h>"`.)

Public header files should include interface documentation in Doxygen
format.

Private header files, describing interfaces that are for internal use
within a library but not for public use, are kept in the source tree at the
same level as their related C files, and often have `"_p"` in their names,
e.g. `lib/isc/task_p.h`.

Header files that define modules should have a structure like the
following.  Note that `<isc/lang.h>` MUST be included by any public header
file using the ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS and ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS macros, so the
correct name-mangling happens for function declarations when C++ programs
include the file.  `<isc/lang.h>` SHOULD be included for private header files
or for public files that do not declare any functions.

        ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS
    
        #endif /* ISC_WHATEVER_H */

#### Including Interfaces (.h files)

The first file to be included in a C source file must be config.h.  The
config.h file must never be included by any public header file (that is,
any header file that will be installed by `"make install"`).

Try to include only necessary files, not everything under the sun.
Operating-system-specific files should not be included by most modules; if
they are needed, they should be used with `#ifdef` and controlled by
`configure`.

#### Statements

There should be at most one statement per line.  The comma operator should
not be used to form compound statements.

Bad:

    	if (i > 0) {
    		printf("yes\\n"); i = 0; j = 0;
    		x = 4, y *= 2;
    	}

#### Functions

The use of ANSI C function prototypes is required.

The return type of the function should be listed on a line by itself when
specifying the implementation of the function.  The opening curly brace
should occur on the same line as the argument list, unless the argument
list is more than one line long:

    	static inline void
    	func1(int i) {
    		/* whatever */
    	}
    
    	int
    	func2(int first_argument, int next_argument,
    	      int last_argument)
    	{
    		/* whatever */
    	}

To suppress compiler warnings, unused function arguments must be
declared within the function via the `UNUSED()` macro.

In the function body, local variable declarations must be at the beginning
of the function, followed by any `REQUIRE()` statements, then `UNUSED()`
declarations, then all other code, in that order.  These sections should be
separated by blank lines.

#### Curly Braces

Curly Braces do not get their own indentation.

An opening brace does not start a new line.  The statements enclosed by the
braces should not be on the same line as the opening or closing brace.  A
closing brace should be the only thing on the line, unless it's part of an
else clause.

If a controlling statement (e.g., `if`, `while`, or `for`) or a function
header at the start of a block of code is all on one line, then the opening
brace should at the end of that line. If the controlling statement occupies
multiple lines, then the opening brace should be on the next line by itself.

Historically, when a controlling statement such as `if` or `else` had
only a single action associated with it, then BIND style specified that
no bracing was to used around that action.  This has been revised: in
newly added code, braces are now preferred around all control statement
code blocks.  Note that legacy code has not yet been udpated to adhere to
this.

Good:

       static void
       f(int i) {
               if (i > 0) {
                       printf("yes\\n");
                       i = 0;
               } else {
                       printf("no\\n");
               }
       }

Bad:

       void f(int i)
         {
           if(i<0){i=0;printf("was negative\\n");}
           if (i == 0)
               printf("no\\n");
           if (i > 0)
             {
               printf("yes\\n");
               i = 0;
             }}

#### Spaces

* DO put a space between operators like `=`, `+`, `==`, etc.
* DO put a space after `,`.
* DO put a space after `;` in a `for` statement.
* DO put spaces after C reserved words such as `if`, `for`, `while`, and `do`.
* DO put a space after `return`, and parenthesize the return value.
* Do NOT put a space between a variable or function name and `(` or `[`.
* Do NOT put a space after the `sizeof` operator name, and DO parenthesize its argument: `malloc(4 * sizeof(long))`.
* Do NOT put a space immediately after a `(` or immediately before a `)`, unless it improves readability.  The same goes for `[` and `]`.
* Do NOT put a space before `++` or `--` when used in post-increment/ decrement mode, or after them when used in pre-increment/decrement mode.
* Do NOT put a space before `;` when terminating a statement or in a `for` statement.
* Do NOT put a space after `*` when used to dereference a pointer, or on either side of `->`.
* Do NOT put a space after `~`.
* The `|` operator may either have a space on both sides or it may have no spaces, depending on readability.  Either way, if the `|` operator is used more than once in a statement, then the spacing must be consistent.

#### Return Values

If a function returns a value, it should be cast to `(void)` if you don't
care what the value is, except for `printf` and its variants, `fputc`,
`fwrite` (when writing text), `fflush`, `memmove`, `memset`, `strcpy`,
`strncpy`, and `strcat`.

Certain functions will return values or not depending on the operating
system or even compiler flags; these include `openlog` and `srandom`.  The
return value of these should not be used nor cast to `(void)`.

All error conditions must be handled.

Mixing of error status and valid results within a single type should be
avoided.

Good:

    	os_result_t result;
    	os_descriptor_t	s;
    
    	result = os_socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0, &s);
    	if (result != OS_R_SUCCESS) {
    		/* Do something about the error. */
    		return;
    	}

Not so good:

    	int s;
    
    	/*
    	 * Obviously using interfaces like socket() (below) is allowed
    	 * since otherwise you couldn't call operating system routines; the
    	 * point is not to write more interfaces like them.
    	 */
    	s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    	if (s < 0) {
    		/* Do something about the error using errno. */
    		return;
    	}

#### Integral Types

Careful thought should be given to whether an integral type should be
signed or unsigned, and to whether a specific size is required.  `int`
should be used for generic variables (e.g. iteration counters, array
subscripts).  Other than for generic variables, if a negative value isn't
meaningful, the variable should be unsigned.  Assignments and comparisons
between signed and unsigned integers should be avoided; suppressing the
warnings with casts is not desireable.

Typedefs are provided to specify particular sizes of integral variables,
e.g., `isc_uint32_t` (unsigned 32-bit integer), `isc_int16_t` (signed
16-bit integer).  These may be used when `unsigned long` or `short` could
be ambiguous.

#### Clear Success or Failure

A function should report success or failure, and do so accurately.  It
should never fail silently.  Use of [design by contract](dev.md#dbc)
can help here.

When a function is designed to return results to the caller by assigning
to caller variables through pointer arguments, it should perform the
assignment only if it succeeds, and leave the variables unmodified if it
fails.  A `REQUIRE()` statement should be used to ensure that the pointer
is in a sane state when the function is called.

The `isc_result_t` is provided for use by result codes.  See the
[results](dev.md#results) section of the [developer
information](dev.md) page for more details.

#### Testing Bits

Bit testing should be as follows:

Good:

    	/* Test if flag set. */
    	if ((flags & FOO) != 0) {
    
    	}
    	/* Test if flag clear. */
    	if ((flags & BAR) == 0) {
    
    	}
    	/* Test if both flags set. */
    	if ((flags & (FOO|BAR)) == (FOO|BAR)) {
    
    	}

Bad:

    	/* Test if flag set. */
    	if (flags & FOO) {
    
    	}
    	/* Test if flag clear. */
    	if (! (flags & BAR)) {
    
    	}

#### Testing for Zero or Non-zero

Explicit testing against zero is required for numeric, non-boolean
variables.

Good: 

    	int i = 10;
    
    	/* ... */
    
    	if (i != 0) {
    		/* Do something. */
    	}

Bad:

    	int i = 10;
    
    	/* ... */
    
    	if (i) {
    		/* Do something. */
    	}

#### Null Pointer

The null pointer value should be referred to as `NULL`, not `0`.

Testing to see whether a pointer is `NULL` should be an explicit
comparison; do not treat a pointer variable as if it were a boolean.

Good:

    	char *c = NULL;
    
    	/* ... */
    
    	if (c != NULL) {
    		/* Do something. */
    	}

Bad:

    	char *c = NULL;
    
    	/* ... */
    
    	if (c) {
    		/* Do something. */
    	}

#### The Ternary Operator

The `?:` operator should mostly be avoided.  It is tolerated when deciding
what value to pass as a parameter to a function, such as frequently happens
with printf, and also when a simple (non-compound) value is being used in
assignment or as part of a calculation.

If a statement containing a ternary operator spills over more than one
line, put the `?` and `:` at the begginning of the following lines with two
additional spaces of indent.

Using the ternary operator to specify a return value is very rarely
permissible, and never when returning result codes.

Good:

    	printf("%c is%s a number.\\n", c, isdigit(c) ? "" : " NOT");
    	l = (l1 < l2) ? l1 : l2;
    	s = (a_very_long_variable < an_even_longer_variable)
    	      ? "true"
    	      : "false";
    	if (gp.length + (go < 16384 ? 2 : 3) >= name->length) {
    		/* whatever */
    	}

    Okay:

    	return ((length1 < length2) ? -1 : 1);

    Bad:

    	return (success ? ISC_R_SUCCESS : ISC_R_FAILURE);

#### Assignment in Parameters

Variables should not have their values assigned or changed when being
passed as parameters, except perhaps for the increment and decrement
operators.

Bad:

    	isc_mem_get(mctx, size = 20);

Okay:

    	fputc(c++, stdout);

#### Invalidating Pointers

When the data a pointer points to has been freed, or is otherwise no longer
valid, the pointer should be set to `NULL` unless the pointer is part of a
structure which is itself going to be freed immediately.

Good:

    	char *text;
    
    	/* text is initialized here. */
    
    	isc_mem_free(mctx, text);
    	text = NULL;

#### <a name="public_namespace"></a>Public Interface Namespace

All public interfaces to functions, macros, typedefs, and variables
provided by the library, should use names of the form
`{library}_{module}_{what}`, such as:

    	isc_buffer_t                            /* typedef */
    	dns_name_setbuffer(name, buffer)        /* function */
    	ISC_LIST_HEAD(list)                     /* macro */
    	isc_commandline_argument                /* variable */

Structures which are `typedef`'d generally have the name of the typedef
sans the final `_t`:

    	typedef struct dns_rbtnode dns_rbtnode_t;
    	struct dns_rbtnode {
    		/* ... members ... */
    	}

In some cases, structures are specific to a single C file and are
opaque outside that file.  In these cases, the `typedef` occurs in the
associated header file, but the structure definition in the C file
itself.  Examples of this include the zone object `dns_zone_t`;
the structure is only acessable via get/set functions in
`lib/dns/zone.c`.  Other times, structure members can be accessed
from outside the C file where they are implemented; examples include
`dns_view_t`.  Which way to implement a particular object is up to
the developer's discretion.

Generally speaking, macros are defined with all capital letters, but this
is not universally consistent (eg, numerous `isc_buffer_{foo}` macros).

The `{module}` and `{what}` segments of the name do not have underscores
separating natural word elements, as demonstrated in
`isc_commandline_argument` and `dns_name_setbuffer` above.  The `{module}`
part is usually the same as the basename of the source file, but sometimes
other `{module}` interfaces appear within one file, such as `dns_label_*`
interfaces in `lib/dns/name.c`.  However, in the public libraries the file
name must be the same as some module interface provided by the file; e.g.,
`dns_rbt_*` interfaces would not be declared in a file named redblack.c (in
lieu of any other `dns_redblack_*` interfaces in the file).

The one notable exception to this naming rule is the interfaces provided by
`<isc/util.h>`.  There's a large caveat associated with the public
description of this file that it is hazardous to use because it pollutes
the general namespace.

When the signature of a public function needs to change, the old function
name should be retained for backward compatibility, if at all possible.
For example, when `dns_zone_setfile()` needed to include a file format
parameter, it was changed to `dns_zone_setfile2()`; the original function
name became a wrapper for the new function, calling it with the default
value of the format parameter:

        isc_result_t
        dns_zone_setfile(dns_zone_t *zone, const char *file) {
                return (dns_zone_setfile2(zone, file, dns_masterformat_text);
        }

        isc_result_t
        dns_zone_setfile2(dns_zone_t *zone, const char *file,
                          dns_masterformat_t format)
        {
                ...
        }

#### <a name="private_namespace"></a>Shared Private Interfaces

When a module provides an interface for internal use by other modules in
the library or by unit tests, it should use the same naming convention
described for the public interfaces, except `{library}` and `{module}` are
separated by a double-underscore.  This indicates that the name is
internal, its API is not as formal as the public API, and thus it might
change without any sort of notice.  Examples of this usage include
`dns__zone_loadpending()` and `isc__taskmgr_ready()`.

In many cases, a public interface is instantiated by a private back-end
implementation.  The double-underscore naming style is sometimes used in
that situation; for example, `isc_task_attach()` calls the `attach`
function provided by a task API implementation; in BIND 9, this function
is provided by `isc__task_attach()`.

Other times, private interface implementations are static functions
that are pointed to by "method" tables.  For example, the `dns_db`
interface is implemented in several places, including `lib/dns/rbtdb.c`
(the red-black tree database used for internal storage of zones and
cache data) and `lib/dns/sdlz.c` (an interface to DLZ modules).
An object of type `dns_dbmethods_t` is created for each of these,
containing function pointers to the local implementations of each
of the `dns_db` API functions.  The `dns_db_findnode()` function
is provided by static functions called `findnode()` in each file,
and so on.

#### Initialization

When an object is allocated from the heap, all fields in the object must be
initialized.

#### Dead Code Pruning

Source which becomes obsolete should be removed, not just disabled with
`#if 0 ... #endif`.

#### Portability

When using a C library function, consider whether all operating systems
support it.  Is it in the POSIX standard?  If so, how long has it been
there? (BIND is still run on some operating systems released in the
1990s.)  Is its behavior the same on all platforms?  Is its signature
the same?  Are integer parameters the same size and signedness?  Does it
alwasy return the same values on success, and set the same `errno` codes
on failure?

If there is a chance the library call may not be completely portable,
edit `configure.in` to check for it on the local system and only call
it from within a suitable `#ifdef`.  If the function is nonoptional, 
it may be necessary to add your own implentation of it (or copy one
from a source with a BSD-compatible license).

BIND provides portable internal versions of many common library calls.
Some are designed to ensure that library calls have standardized
[ISC result codes](dev.md#results) instead of using potentially
nonwportable `errno` values; these include the file operations
in `isc_file` and `isc_stdio`.  Others, such as `isc_tm_strptime()`,
are needed to ensure consistent cross-platform behavior.
Others simply provide needed functions on platforms that don't
have them: for example, `isc_string_strlcpy()`  is an implementation
of the BSD-specific `strlcpy()` function.  On Linux and systems
without a `strlcpy()` function, it is `#define`d to `isc_string_strlcpy()`

In some cases, UNIX and Windows implementations of functions are kept
in separate files, such as `lib/isc/unix/file.c` and `lib/isc/win32/file.c`.

#### Some notes on standard functions

* Always use `memmove()` rather than `memcpy()`.
* If using `snprintf()` in a source file, be sure it includes `<isc/print.h>`

#### Log messages

Error and warning messages should be logged through the [logging
system](dev.md#logging).  Debugging `printf`s may be used during
development, but must be removed when the debugging is finished.

Log messages do not start with a capital letter, nor do they end in a
period, and they are not followed by newlines.

When variable text such as a file name or domain name occurs as part of a
log message, it should be enclosed in single quotes, as in "zone '%s' is
lame".

When the variable text forms a separate phrase, such as when it separated
from the rest of the message by a colon, it can be left unquoted:

   	isc_log_write(... "open: %s: %s", filename, isc_result_totext(result));

File names (`__FILE__`), line numbers (`__LINE__`), function names,
memory addresses, and other references to program internals may be used
in debugging messages and in messages to report programming errors detected
at runtime.  They may not be used in messages that indicate errors in the
program's inputs or operation.

### <a name="pystyle"></a>Python

BIND 9 contains some optional tools written in Python, in the `bin/python` subdirectory.  Python scripts are stored in the git repository as `{toolname}.py.in`; and `{toolname}.py` will be generated by `configure` (which determines, among other things, the path to the Python interpreter).

For Python coding, we abide by the Python style guidelines described [here](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), with a few modifications:

* The `__init__()` method should always be the first one declared in a
  class definition, like so:

        class Foo:
            # constructor definition here
            def __init__(self):
                ...
            # other functions may follow
            def bar(self):
                ...
                Close all file and socket objects

* All Python standard library objects that have an underlying file
  descriptor (fd) should be closed explicitly using the `.close()` method.

* In cases where a file is opened and closed in a single block, it
  is often preferable to use the `with` statement:

        with open('filename') as f:
            do_something_with(f)

### <a name="plstyle"></a>Perl

Perl is NOT required for building, installing, or using the BIND 9 name
server.  However, BIND 9 may use Perl for its system test environment, for
certain optional server add-on components, and in some cases for generating
source files (such as `bind9.xsl.h`, converted from `bind9.xsl`) which are
then committed to to the git repository.

Perl 5 is assumed; Perl scripts do not need to work in Perl 4.

Perl source code should follow the conventions for C source code where
applicable.

### <a name="shstyle"></a>Bourne Shell

Shell scripts must be as portable as possible and should therefore conform
strictly to POSIX standards.  Shell extensions such as those introduced in
Bash should be avoided.  Some pitfalls to avoid:

* To capture the output of a command, use `` `backquotes` `` rather than
  `$(parentheses)`
* For arithmetical computation, use `` `expr {expression}` ``, not
  `$((expression))`
* To text string length use `` `expr $string : ".*"` `` rather than ``
  `expr length $string` ``
* To test for the presence of a string in a file without printing anything
  to stdout, use `"grep string filename > /dev/null 2>&1"`, rather than
  `"grep -q string filename"`.
* To test for file existence use `"test -f"` rather than `"test -e"`
* Don't use newline (`\\n`) when calling `echo`. Either use another `echo`
  statement, or use `"cat << EOF"`.
* To set a variable from outside awk, use `"awk '{...}' var=value"` rather
  than `"awk -vvar=value '{...}'"`
