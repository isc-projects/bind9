Notes on CVS Usage

Accessing the repository


The recommended way of accessing the BIND 9 CVS repository is by ssh
to rc.isc.org, using the following environment settings:

   CVSROOT=:ext:rc.isc.org:/proj/cvs/isc
   CVS_RSH=ssh


Creating a release branch


Here's how the 9.0 release branch was created:

  cvs rtag v9_0_base bind9
  cvs rtag -b -r v9_0_base v9_0 bind9



Renaming files by repository copy


When you need to rename or move a file that is under CVS control, use
the "repository copy" method as described in the following text
borrowed from an ancient CVS FAQ:

        2C.4   How do I rename a file?

        CVS does not offer a way to rename a file in a way that CVS can
        track later.  See Section 4B for more information.

        Here is the best way to get the effect of renaming, while
        preserving the change log:

           1. Copy the RCS (",v") file directly in the Repository.

                cp $CVSROOT/<odir>/<ofile>,v $CVSROOT/<ndir>/<nfile>,v

           2. Remove the old file using CVS.

              By duplicating the file, you will preserve the change
              history and the ability to retrieve earlier revisions of the
              old file via the "-r <tag/rev>" or "-D <date>" options to
              "checkout" and "update".

                cd <working-dir>/<odir>
                rm <ofile>
                cvs remove <ofile>
                cvs commit <ofile>

           3. Retrieve <newfile> and remove all the Tags from it.

              By stripping off all the old Tags, the "checkout -r" and
              "update -r" commands won't retrieve revisions Tagged before
              the renaming.

                cd <working-dir>/<ndir>
                cvs update <nfile>
                cvs log <nfile>                 # Save the list of Tags
                cvs tag -d <tag1> <nfile>
                cvs tag -d <tag2> <nfile>
                . . .


        This technique can be used to rename files within one directory or
        across different directories.  You can apply this idea to
        directories too, as long as you apply the above to each file and
        don't delete the old directory.

        Of course, you have to change the build system (e.g. Makefile) in
        your <working-dir> to know about the name change.


Pulling up a newly added file to a release branch:

In a mainline working tree, do something like this:

  cvs tag v9_0_base file
  cvs tag -b -r v9_0_base v9_0 file


Importing contrib source from vendor release

As an example, here's how queryperf was imported:

  cd /tmp
  cvs -d shell.nominum.com:/proj/cvs/nominum export -rHEAD queryperf
  cd queryperf
  cvs -d rc.isc.org:/proj/cvs/isc import bind9/contrib/queryperf \
	NOMINUM NOMINUM_20010710
