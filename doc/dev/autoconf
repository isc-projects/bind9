Here are some hints on how to use autoconf correctly when doing
BIND 9 development.

Never edit the configure script directly.  Edit configure.in, commit
the changes, run "autoconf", and commit the new configure.  Doing two
separate commits ensures that the version numbers embedded in the
configure script are correct.

Don't edit config.h.in directly.  Instead, run "autoheader".  If it
complains about missing definitions, add them to acconfig.h, rerun
autoheader, commit acconfig.h if edited, and commit the generated
config.h.in.
