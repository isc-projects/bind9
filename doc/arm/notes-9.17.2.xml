          The BIND 9 build system has been changed to use the normal build tool
          stack consisting of autoconf+automake+libtool.  This should not make
          any difference for people building BIND 9 from the release tarballs,
          but if you are building BIND 9 from the git repository, or you are
          using non-standard <command>./configure</command> option, you will
          need to pay extra attention. [GL #4]
