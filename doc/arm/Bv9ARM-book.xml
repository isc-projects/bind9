    <para>
      The Internet Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)
      consists of the syntax
      to specify the names of entities in the Internet in a hierarchical
      manner, the rules used for delegating authority over names, and the
      system implementation that actually maps names to Internet
      addresses.  <acronym>DNS</acronym> data is maintained in a
      group of distributed
      hierarchical databases.

    <section xml:id="dns_overview"><info><title>The Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)</title></info>

      <para>
	This document explains the installation
	and upkeep of the <acronym>BIND</acronym> (Berkeley Internet
	Name Domain) software package. We
	begin by reviewing the fundamentals of the Domain Name System
	(<acronym>DNS</acronym>) as they relate to <acronym>BIND</acronym>.
      </para>

      <section xml:id="dns_fundamentals"><info><title>DNS Fundamentals</title></info>

	<para>
	  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, distributed
	  database.  It stores information for mapping Internet host names to
	  IP
	  addresses and vice versa, mail routing information, and other data
	  used by Internet applications.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Clients look up information in the DNS by calling a
	  <emphasis>resolver</emphasis> library, which sends queries to one or
	  more <emphasis>name servers</emphasis> and interprets the responses.
	  The <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 software distribution
	  contains a name server, <command>named</command>, and a
	  resolver library, <command>liblwres</command>.
	</para>

	</section>
	<section xml:id="domain_names"><info><title>Domains and Domain Names</title></info>

	<para>
	  The data stored in the DNS is identified by <emphasis>domain names</emphasis> that are organized as a tree according to
	  organizational or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree,
	  called a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, is given a label. The domain
	  name of the
	  node is the concatenation of all the labels on the path from the
	  node to the <emphasis>root</emphasis> node.  This is represented
	  in written form as a string of labels listed from right to left and
	  separated by dots. A label need only be unique within its parent
	  domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For example, a domain name for a host at the
	  company <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis> could be
	  <literal>ourhost.example.com</literal>,
	  where <literal>com</literal> is the
	  top level domain to which
	  <literal>ourhost.example.com</literal> belongs,
	  <literal>example</literal> is
	  a subdomain of <literal>com</literal>, and
	  <literal>ourhost</literal> is the
	  name of the host.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For administrative purposes, the name space is partitioned into
	  areas called <emphasis>zones</emphasis>, each starting at a node and
	  extending down to the "leaf" nodes or to nodes where other zones
	  start.
	  The data for each zone is stored in a <emphasis>name server</emphasis>, which answers queries about the zone using the
	  <emphasis>DNS protocol</emphasis>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The data associated with each domain name is stored in the
	  form of <emphasis>resource records</emphasis> (<acronym>RR</acronym>s).
	  Some of the supported resource record types are described in
	  <xref linkend="types_of_resource_records_and_when_to_use_them"/>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For more detailed information about the design of the DNS and
	  the DNS protocol, please refer to the standards documents listed in
	  <xref linkend="rfcs"/>.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="zones"><info><title>Zones</title></info>

	<para>
	  To properly operate a name server, it is important to understand
	  the difference between a <emphasis>zone</emphasis>
	  and a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  As stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in
	  the <acronym>DNS</acronym> tree. A zone consists of
	  those contiguous parts of the domain
	  tree for which a name server has complete information and over which
	  it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point
	  downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to
	  other zones. A delegation point is marked by one or more
	  <emphasis>NS records</emphasis> in the
	  parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at
	  the root of the delegated zone.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For instance, consider the <literal>example.com</literal>
	  domain which includes names
	  such as <literal>host.aaa.example.com</literal> and
	  <literal>host.bbb.example.com</literal> even though
	  the <literal>example.com</literal> zone includes
	  only delegations for the <literal>aaa.example.com</literal> and
	  <literal>bbb.example.com</literal> zones.  A zone can
	  map
	  exactly to a single domain, but could also include only part of a
	  domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other
	  name servers. Every name in the <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	  tree is a
	  <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, even if it is
	  <emphasis>terminal</emphasis>, that is, has no
	  <emphasis>subdomains</emphasis>.  Every subdomain is a domain and
	  every domain except the root is also a subdomain. The terminology is
	  not intuitive and we suggest reading RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035
	  to
	  gain a complete understanding of this difficult and subtle
	  topic.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Though <acronym>BIND</acronym> is called a "domain name
	  server",
	  it deals primarily in terms of zones. The "primary" and "secondary"
	  declarations in the <filename>named.conf</filename> file
	  specify
	  zones, not domains. When BIND asks some other site if it is willing to
	  be a secondary server for a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, it is
	  actually asking for secondary service for some collection of <emphasis>zones</emphasis>.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="auth_servers"><info><title>Authoritative Name Servers</title></info>

	<para>
	  Each zone is served by at least
	  one <emphasis>authoritative name server</emphasis>,
	  which contains the complete data for the zone.
	  To make the DNS tolerant of server and network failures,
	  most zones have two or more authoritative servers, on
	  different networks.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Responses from authoritative servers have the "authoritative
	  answer" (AA) bit set in the response packets.  This makes them
	  easy to identify when debugging DNS configurations using tools like
	  <command>dig</command> (<xref linkend="diagnostic_tools"/>).
	</para>

	<section xml:id="primary_master"><info><title>The Primary Server</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The authoritative server where the main copy of the zone
	    data is maintained is called the
	    <emphasis>primary</emphasis> (or
	    <command>master</command>) server, or simply the
	    <emphasis>primary</emphasis>.  Typically it loads the zone
	    contents from some local file edited by humans or perhaps
	    generated mechanically from some other local file which is
	    edited by humans.  This file is called the
	    <emphasis>zone file</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>master file</emphasis>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    In some cases, however, the zone file may not be edited
	    by humans at all, but may instead be the result of
	    <emphasis>dynamic update</emphasis> operations.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="slave_server"><info><title>Secondary Servers</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The other authoritative servers, called the
	    <emphasis>secondary</emphasis>
	    (or <command>slave</command>) servers, load the zone
	    contents from another server using a replication
	    process known as a <emphasis>zone transfer</emphasis>.
	    Typically the data is transferred directly from the primary
	    master, but it is also possible to transfer it from another
	    secondary.  In other words, a secondary server may itself act as a
	    primary to a subordinate secondary server.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Periodically, the secondary server must send a refresh query to
	    determine whether the zone contents have been updated. This
	    is done by sending a query for the zone's Start of Authority (SOA) record and
	    checking whether the SERIAL field has been updated; if so,
	    a new transfer request is initiated. The timing of these
	    refresh queries is controlled by the SOA REFRESH and RETRY
	    fields, but can be overridden with the
	    <command>max-refresh-time</command>,
	    <command>min-refresh-time</command>,
	    <command>max-retry-time</command>, and
	    <command>min-retry-time</command> options.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the zone data cannot be updated within the time specified
	    by the SOA EXPIRE option (up to a hard-coded maximum of
	    24 weeks), the secondary zone expires and no longer
	    responds to queries.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="stealth_server"><info><title>Stealth Servers</title></info>

	  <para>
	    Usually, all of the zone's authoritative servers are listed in
	    NS records in the parent zone.  These NS records constitute
	    a <emphasis>delegation</emphasis> of the zone from the parent.
	    The authoritative servers are also listed in the zone file itself,
	    at the <emphasis>top level</emphasis> or <emphasis>apex</emphasis>
	    of the zone.  Servers that are not in the parent's NS delegation can be listed in the zone's top-level NS
	    records, but servers that are not present at
	    the zone's top level cannot be listed in the parent's delegation.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A <emphasis>stealth server</emphasis> is a server that is
	    authoritative for a zone but is not listed in that zone's NS
	    records.  Stealth servers can be used for keeping a local copy of
	    a
	    zone, to speed up access to the zone's records, or to make sure that
	    the
	    zone is available even if all the "official" servers for the zone
	    are
	    inaccessible.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A configuration where the primary server itself is a
	    stealth server is often referred to as a "hidden primary"
	    configuration.  One use for this configuration is when the primary
	    is behind a firewall and is therefore unable to communicate directly
	    with the outside world.
	  </para>

	</section>

      </section>
      <section xml:id="cache_servers"><info><title>Caching Name Servers</title></info>

	<!--
	  - Terminology here is inconsistent.  Probably ought to
	  - convert to using "recursive name server" everywhere
	  - with just a note about "caching" terminology.
	  -->

	<para>
	  The resolver libraries provided by most operating systems are
	  <emphasis>stub resolvers</emphasis>, meaning that they are not
	  capable of
	  performing the full DNS resolution process by themselves by talking
	  directly to the authoritative servers.  Instead, they rely on a
	  local
	  name server to perform the resolution on their behalf.  Such a
	  server
	  is called a <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> name server; it performs
	  <emphasis>recursive lookups</emphasis> for local clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To improve performance, recursive servers cache the results of
	  the lookups they perform.  Since the processes of recursion and
	  caching are intimately connected, the terms
	  <emphasis>recursive server</emphasis> and
	  <emphasis>caching server</emphasis> are often used synonymously.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The length of time for which a record may be retained in
	  the cache of a caching name server is controlled by the
	  Time-To-Live (TTL) field associated with each resource record.
	</para>

	<section xml:id="forwarder"><info><title>Forwarding</title></info>

	  <para>
	    Even a caching name server does not necessarily perform
	    the complete recursive lookup itself.  Instead, it can
	    <emphasis>forward</emphasis> some or all of the queries
	    that it cannot satisfy from its cache to another caching name
	    server,
	    commonly referred to as a <emphasis>forwarder</emphasis>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Forwarders are typically used when an administrator does not
	    wish for all the servers at a given site to interact
	    directly with the rest of the Internet. For example, a
	    common scenario is when multiple internal DNS servers are
	    behind an Internet firewall. Servers behind the firewall
	    forward their requests to the server with external access,
	    which queries Internet DNS servers on the internal servers'
	    behalf.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Another scenario (largely now superseded by Response Policy
	    Zones) is to send queries first to a custom server for RBL
	    processing before forwarding them to the wider Internet.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    There may be one or more forwarders in a given setup. The
	    order in which the forwarders are listed in
	    <filename>named.conf</filename> does not determine the
	    sequence in which they are queried; rather,
	    <command>named</command> uses the response times from
	    previous queries to select the server that is likely to
	    respond the most quickly. A server that has not yet been
	    queried is given an initial small random response time to
	    ensure that it is tried at least once. Dynamic adjustment of
	    the recorded response times ensures that all forwarders are
	    queried, even those with slower response times.  This
	    permits changes in behavior based on server responsiveness.
	  </para>
	</section>

      </section>

      <section xml:id="multi_role"><info><title>Name Servers in Multiple Roles</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <acronym>BIND</acronym> name server can
	  simultaneously act as
	  a primary for some zones, a secondary for other zones, and a caching
	  (recursive) server for a set of local clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  However, since the functions of authoritative name service
	  and caching/recursive name service are logically separate, it is
	  often advantageous to run them on separate server machines.

	  A server that only provides authoritative name service
	  (an <emphasis>authoritative-only</emphasis> server) can run with
	  recursion disabled, improving reliability and security.

	  A server that is not authoritative for any zones and only provides
	  recursive service to local
	  clients (a <emphasis>caching-only</emphasis> server)
	  does not need to be reachable from the Internet at large and can
	  be placed inside a firewall.

      <para>
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> hardware requirements have

	For many installations, servers that have been retired from

      </para>
      <para>
	However, the DNSSEC features of <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9
	may be quite
	CPU-intensive, so organizations that make heavy use of these
	features may wish to consider larger systems for these applications.
	<acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 is fully multithreaded, allowing
	full utilization of

      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="cpu_req"><info><title>CPU Requirements</title></info>
      <para>
	CPU requirements for <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 range from
	i386-class machines,
	for serving static zones without caching, to enterprise-class
	machines to process many dynamic updates and DNSSEC-signed zones,
	serving many thousands of queries per second.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="mem_req"><info><title>Memory Requirements</title></info>
      <para>
	Server memory must be sufficient to hold both the
	cache and the zones loaded from disk.  The <command>max-cache-size</command>
	option can limit the amount of memory used by the cache,
	at the expense of reducing cache hit rates and causing more <acronym>DNS</acronym>
	traffic.
	If additional section caching
	(<xref linkend="acache"/>) is enabled,
	the <command>max-acache-size</command> option can be used to
	limit the amount
	of memory used by the mechanism.
	It is still good practice to have enough memory to load
	all zone and cache data into memory; unfortunately, the best
	way
	to determine this for a given installation is to watch the name server
	in operation. After a few weeks, the server process should reach
	a relatively stable size where entries are expiring from the cache as
	fast as they are being inserted.

      <para>
	For name server-intensive environments, there are two
	configurations that may be used. The first is one where clients and
	any second-level internal name servers query a main name server, which
	has enough memory to build a large cache; this approach minimizes
	the bandwidth used by external name lookups. The second alternative
	is to set up second-level internal name servers to make queries
	independently.
	In this configuration, none of the individual machines need to
	have as much memory or CPU power as in the first alternative, but
	this has the disadvantage of making many more external queries,
	as none of the name servers share their cached data.

		<para>
		  <command>rndc</command> requires a configuration file,
		  since all
		  communication with the server is authenticated with
		  digital signatures that rely on a shared secret, and
		  there is no way to provide that secret other than with a
		  configuration file.  The default location for the
		  <command>rndc</command> configuration file is
		  <filename>/etc/rndc.conf</filename>, but an
		  alternate
		  location can be specified with the <option>-c</option>
		  option.  If the configuration file is not found,
		  <command>rndc</command> also looks in
		  <filename>/etc/rndc.key</filename> (or whatever
		  <varname>sysconfdir</varname> was defined when
		  the <acronym>BIND</acronym> build was
		  configured).
		  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> file is
		  generated by
		  running <command>rndc-confgen -a</command> as
		  described in
		  <xref linkend="controls_statement_definition_and_usage"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The format of the configuration file is similar to
		  that of <filename>named.conf</filename>, but is
		  limited to
		  only four statements: the <command>options</command>,
		  <command>key</command>, <command>server</command>, and
		  <command>include</command>
		  statements.  These statements are what associate the
		  secret keys to the servers with which they are meant to
		  be shared.  The order of statements is not
		  significant.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>options</command> statement has
		  three clauses:
		  <command>default-server</command>, <command>default-key</command>,
		  and <command>default-port</command>.
		  <command>default-server</command> takes a
		  host name or address argument and represents the server
		  that
		  is contacted if no <option>-s</option>
		  option is provided on the command line.
		  <command>default-key</command> takes
		  the name of a key as its argument, as defined by a <command>key</command> statement.
		  <command>default-port</command> specifies the
		  port to which
		  <command>rndc</command> should connect if no
		  port is given on the command line or in a
		  <command>server</command> statement.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>key</command> statement defines a
		  key to be used
		  by <command>rndc</command> when authenticating
		  with
		  <command>named</command>.  Its syntax is
		  identical to the
		  <command>key</command> statement in <filename>named.conf</filename>.
		  The keyword <userinput>key</userinput> is
		  followed by a key name, which must be a valid
		  domain name, though it need not actually be hierarchical;
		  thus,
		  a string like "<userinput>rndc_key</userinput>" is a valid
		  name.
		  The <command>key</command> statement has two
		  clauses:
		  <command>algorithm</command> and <command>secret</command>.
		  While the configuration parser accepts any string as the
		  argument
		  to <command>algorithm</command>, currently only the strings
		  "<userinput>hmac-md5</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha1</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha224</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha256</userinput>",
		  "<userinput>hmac-sha384</userinput>",
		  and "<userinput>hmac-sha512</userinput>"
		  have any meaning.  The secret is a Base64-encoded string
		  as specified in RFC 3548.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>server</command> statement
		  associates a key
		  defined using the <command>key</command>
		  statement with a server.
		  The keyword <userinput>server</userinput> is followed by a
		  host name or address.  The <command>server</command> statement
		  has two clauses: <command>key</command> and <command>port</command>.
		  The <command>key</command> clause specifies the
		  name of the key
		  to be used when communicating with this server, and the
		  <command>port</command> clause can be used to
		  specify the port <command>rndc</command> should
		  connect
		  to on the server.
		</para>

		<para>
		  A sample minimal configuration file is as follows:
		</para>

<programlisting>
key rndc_key {
     algorithm "hmac-sha256";
     secret
       "c3Ryb25nIGVub3VnaCBmb3IgYSBtYW4gYnV0IG1hZGUgZm9yIGEgd29tYW4K";
};
options {
     default-server 127.0.0.1;
     default-key    rndc_key;
};
</programlisting>

		<para>
		  This file, if installed as <filename>/etc/rndc.conf</filename>,
		  allows the command:
		</para>

		<para>
		  <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>rndc reload</userinput>
		</para>

		<para>
		  to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 953 and causes the name server
		  to reload, if a name server on the local machine is
		  running with
		  following controls statements:
		</para>

<programlisting>
controls {
	inet 127.0.0.1
	    allow { localhost; } keys { rndc_key; };
};
</programlisting>

		<para>
		  and it has an identical key statement for
		  <literal>rndc_key</literal>.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Running the <command>rndc-confgen</command>
		  program
		  conveniently creates an <filename>rndc.conf</filename>
		  file, and also displays the
		  corresponding <command>controls</command>
		  statement needed to
		  add to <filename>named.conf</filename>.
		  Alternatively,
		  it is possible to run <command>rndc-confgen -a</command>
		  to set up
		  an <filename>rndc.key</filename> file and not
		  modify
		  <filename>named.conf</filename> at all.

      <para>
	<acronym>DNS</acronym> NOTIFY is a mechanism that allows primary
	servers to notify their secondary servers of changes to a zone's data. In
	response to a <command>NOTIFY</command> from a primary server, the
	secondary checks to see that its version of the zone is the
	current version and, if not, initiates a zone transfer.

    <section xml:id="dynamic_update"><info><title>Dynamic Update</title></info>

      <para>
	Dynamic Update is a method for adding, replacing, or deleting
	records in a primary server by sending it a special form of DNS
	messages.  The format and meaning of these messages is specified
	in RFC 2136.
      </para>

      <para>
	Dynamic update is enabled by including an
	<command>allow-update</command> or an <command>update-policy</command>
	clause in the <command>zone</command> statement.
      </para>

      <para>
	If the zone's <command>update-policy</command> is set to
	<userinput>local</userinput>, updates to the zone
	are permitted for the key <varname>local-ddns</varname>,
	which is generated by <command>named</command> at startup.
	See <xref linkend="dynamic_update_policies"/> for more details.
      </para>

      <para>
	Dynamic updates using Kerberos-signed requests can be made
	using the TKEY/GSS protocol, either by setting the
	<command>tkey-gssapi-keytab</command> option, or
	by setting both the <command>tkey-gssapi-credential</command>
	and <command>tkey-domain</command> options. Once enabled,
	Kerberos-signed requests are matched against the update
	policies for the zone, using the Kerberos principal as the
	signer for the request.
      </para>

      <para>
	Updating of secure zones (zones using DNSSEC) follows RFC
	3007: RRSIG, NSEC, and NSEC3 records affected by updates are
	automatically regenerated by the server using an online
	zone key.  Update authorization is based on transaction
	signatures and an explicit server policy.
      </para>

      <section xml:id="journal"><info><title>The Journal File</title></info>

	<para>
	  All changes made to a zone using dynamic update are stored
	  in the zone's journal file.  This file is automatically created
	  by the server when the first dynamic update takes place.
	  The name of the journal file is formed by appending the extension
	  <filename>.jnl</filename> to the name of the
	  corresponding zone
	  file, unless specifically overridden.  The journal file is in a
	  binary format and should not be edited manually.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The server also occasionally writes ("dumps")
	  the complete contents of the updated zone to its zone file.
	  This is not done immediately after
	  each dynamic update, because that would be too slow when a large
	  zone is updated frequently.  Instead, the dump is delayed by
	  up to 15 minutes, allowing additional updates to take place.
	  During the dump process, transient files are created
	  with the extensions <filename>.jnw</filename> and
	  <filename>.jbk</filename>; under ordinary circumstances, these
	  are removed when the dump is complete, and can be safely
	  ignored.
	</para>

	<para>
	  When a server is restarted after a shutdown or crash, it replays
	  the journal file to incorporate into the zone any updates that
	  took
	  place after the last zone dump.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Changes that result from incoming incremental zone transfers are
	  also
	  journaled in a similar way.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The zone files of dynamic zones cannot normally be edited by
	  hand because they are not guaranteed to contain the most recent
	  dynamic changes; those are only in the journal file.
	  The only way to ensure that the zone file of a dynamic zone
	  is up-to-date is to run <command>rndc stop</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To make changes to a dynamic zone
	  manually, follow these steps:
	  first, disable dynamic updates to the zone using
	  <command>rndc freeze <replaceable>zone</replaceable></command>.
	  This updates the zone file with the changes
	  stored in its <filename>.jnl</filename> file.
	  Then, edit the zone file.  Finally, run
	  <command>rndc thaw <replaceable>zone</replaceable></command>
	  to reload the changed zone and re-enable dynamic updates.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <command>rndc sync <replaceable>zone</replaceable></command>
	  updates the zone file with changes from the journal file
	  without stopping dynamic updates; this may be useful for viewing
	  the current zone state.  To remove the <filename>.jnl</filename>
	  file after updating the zone file, use
	  <command>rndc sync -clean</command>.

      <para>
	The incremental zone transfer (IXFR) protocol is a way for

	1995. See <xref linkend="proposed_standards"/>.
      </para>

      <para>

    <section xml:id="split_dns"><info><title>Split DNS</title></info>

      <para>
	Setting up different views of the DNS space to
	internal and external resolvers is usually referred to as a
	<emphasis>split DNS</emphasis> setup. There are several
	reasons an organization might want to set up its DNS this way.
      </para>
      <para>
	One common reason to use split DNS is
	to hide "internal" DNS information from "external" clients on the
	Internet. There is some debate as to whether this is actually
	useful.
	Internal DNS information leaks out in many ways (via email headers,
	for example) and most savvy "attackers" can find the information
	they need using other means.
	However, since listing addresses of internal servers that
	external clients cannot possibly reach can result in
	connection delays and other annoyances, an organization may
	choose to use split DNS to present a consistent view of itself
	to the outside world.
      </para>
      <para>
	Another common reason for setting up a split DNS system is
	to allow internal networks that are behind filters or in RFC 1918
	space (reserved IP space, as documented in RFC 1918) to resolve DNS
	on the Internet. Split DNS can also be used to allow mail from outside
	back into the internal network.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="split_dns_sample"><info><title>Example Split DNS Setup</title></info>
	<para>
	  Let's say a company named <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis>
	  (<literal>example.com</literal>)
	  has several corporate sites that have an internal network with
	  reserved
	  Internet Protocol (IP) space and an external demilitarized zone (DMZ),
	  or "outside" section of a network, that is available to the public.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis> wants its internal clients
	  to be able to resolve external hostnames and to exchange mail with
	  people on the outside. The company also wants its internal resolvers
	  to have access to certain internal-only zones that are not available
	  at all outside of the internal network.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In order to accomplish this, the company sets up two sets
	  of name servers. One set is on the inside network (in the
	  reserved
	  IP space) and the other set is on bastion hosts, which are
	  "proxy"
	  hosts in the DMZ that can talk to both sides of its network.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The internal servers are configured to forward all queries,
	  except queries for <filename>site1.internal</filename>, <filename>site2.internal</filename>, <filename>site1.example.com</filename>,
	  and <filename>site2.example.com</filename>, to the servers
	  in the
	  DMZ. These internal servers will have complete sets of information
	  for <filename>site1.example.com</filename>, <filename>site2.example.com</filename>, <filename>site1.internal</filename>,
	  and <filename>site2.internal</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To protect the <filename>site1.internal</filename> and <filename>site2.internal</filename> domains,
	  the internal name servers must be configured to disallow all queries
	  to these domains from any external hosts, including the bastion
	  hosts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The external servers, which are on the bastion hosts, are
	  configured to serve the "public" version of the <filename>site1.example.com</filename> and <filename>site2.example.com</filename> zones.
	  This could include things such as the host records for public servers
	  (<filename>www.example.com</filename> and <filename>ftp.example.com</filename>)
	  and mail exchange (MX) records (<filename>a.mx.example.com</filename> and <filename>b.mx.example.com</filename>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  In addition, the public <filename>site1.example.com</filename> and <filename>site2.example.com</filename> zones
	  should have special MX records that contain wildcard ("*") records
	  pointing to the bastion hosts. This is needed because external mail
	  servers do not have any other way of looking up how to deliver mail
	  to those internal hosts. With the wildcard records, the mail is
	  delivered to the bastion host, which can then forward it on to
	  internal hosts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Here's an example of a wildcard MX record:
	</para>
	<programlisting>*   IN MX 10 external1.example.com.</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Now that they accept mail on behalf of anything in the internal
	  network, the bastion hosts need to know how to deliver mail
	  to internal hosts. The resolvers
	  on
	  the bastion hosts need to be configured to point to the internal
	  name servers for DNS resolution.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Queries for internal hostnames are answered by the internal
	  servers, and queries for external hostnames are forwarded back
	  out to the DNS servers on the bastion hosts.
	</para>
	<para>
	  For all of this to work properly, internal clients
	  need to be configured to query <emphasis>only</emphasis> the internal
	  name servers for DNS queries. This could also be enforced via
	  selective
	  filtering on the network.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If everything has been set properly, <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis>'s
	  internal clients are now able to:

	TSIG (Transaction SIGnatures) is a mechanism for authenticating DNS
	messages, originally specified in RFC 2845. It allows DNS messages
	to be cryptographically signed using a shared secret.  TSIG can
	be used in any DNS transaction, as a way to restrict access to
	certain server functions (e.g., recursive queries) to authorized
	clients when IP-based access control is insufficient or needs to
	be overridden, or as a way to ensure message authenticity when it
	is critical to the integrity of the server, such as with dynamic
	UPDATE messages or zone transfers from a primary to a secondary server.

	<para>
	  TSIG keys can be generated using the <command>tsig-keygen</command>
	  command; the output of the command is a <command>key</command> directive
	  suitable for inclusion in <filename>named.conf</filename>.  The

	  Any string which is a valid DNS name can be used as a key name.
	  For example, a key to be shared between servers called

	<para>
	  For example, a key may be specified for each server in the

    <section xml:id="tkey"><info><title>TKEY</title></info>

      <para>
	TKEY (Transaction KEY) is a mechanism for automatically negotiating
	a shared secret between two hosts, originally specified in RFC 2930.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are several TKEY "modes" that specify how a key is to be
	generated or assigned.  <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 implements only
	one of these modes: Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Both hosts are
	required to have a KEY record with algorithm DH (though this
	record is not required to be present in a zone).
      </para>
      <para>
	The TKEY process is initiated by a client or server by sending
	a query of type TKEY to a TKEY-aware server.  The query must include
	an appropriate KEY record in the additional section, and
	must be signed using either TSIG or SIG(0) with a previously
	established key.  The server's response, if successful,
	contains a TKEY record in its answer section.  After this transaction,
	both participants have enough information to calculate a
	shared secret using Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  The shared secret
	can then be used by to sign subsequent transactions between the
	two servers.
      </para>
      <para>
	TSIG keys known by the server, including TKEY-negotiated keys, can
	be listed using <command>rndc tsig-list</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
	TKEY-negotiated keys can be deleted from a server using
	<command>rndc tsig-delete</command>.  This can also be done via
	the TKEY protocol itself, by sending an authenticated TKEY query
	specifying the "key deletion" mode.
      </para>

    </section>
    <section xml:id="sig0"><info><title>SIG(0)</title></info>

      <para>
	<acronym>BIND</acronym> partially supports DNSSEC SIG(0)
	transaction signatures as specified in RFC 2535 and RFC 2931.
	SIG(0) uses public/private keys to authenticate messages.  Access control
	is performed in the same manner as with TSIG keys; privileges can be
	granted or denied in ACL directives based on the key name.
      </para>
      <para>
	When a SIG(0) signed message is received, it is only
	verified if the key is known and trusted by the server. The
	server does not attempt to recursively fetch or validate the
	key.

      <para>
	In order to set up a DNSSEC secure zone, there are a series

	directory specified by the <option>-d</option> option.
      </para>

      <para>
	There must also be communication with the administrators of
	the parent and/or child zone to transmit keys.  A zone's security
	status must be indicated by the parent zone for a DNSSEC-capable

	or absence of a <literal>DS</literal> record at the
	delegation
	point.
      </para>

      <para>
	For other servers to trust data in this zone, they must

      <section xml:id="dnssec_keys"><info><title>Generating Keys</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>dnssec-keygen</command> program is used to
	  generate keys.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A secure zone must contain one or more zone keys.  The
	  zone keys will sign all other records in the zone, as well as
	  the zone keys of any secure delegated zones.  Zone keys must
	  have the same name as the zone, have a name type of
	  <command>ZONE</command>, and be usable for
	  authentication.
	  It is recommended that zone keys use a cryptographic algorithm
	  designated as "mandatory to implement" by the IETF; currently
	  the only one is RSASHA1.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The following command generates a 768-bit RSASHA1 key for
	  the <filename>child.example</filename> zone:
	</para>

	<para>
	  <userinput>dnssec-keygen -a RSASHA1 -b 768 -n ZONE child.example.</userinput>
	</para>

	<para>

	  <filename>Kchild.example.+005+12345.key</filename> and
	  <filename>Kchild.example.+005+12345.private</filename>
	  (where
	  12345 is an example of a key tag).  The key filenames contain
	  the key name (<filename>child.example.</filename>), the
	  algorithm (3
	  is DSA, 1 is RSAMD5, 5 is RSASHA1, etc.), and the key tag (12345 in
	  this case).
	  The private key (in the <filename>.private</filename>
	  file) is
	  used to generate signatures, and the public key (in the
	  <filename>.key</filename> file) is used for signature
	  verification.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To generate another key with the same properties but with
	  a different key tag, repeat the above command.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <command>dnssec-keyfromlabel</command> program is used
	  to get a key pair from a crypto hardware device and build the key

	  zones need to be added manually.
	</para>

	<para>
	  By default, all zone keys which have an available private key are

	</para>

	<para>
	  <userinput>dnssec-signzone -o child.example zone.child.example</userinput>

      <para>
	Traditionally, applications have been linked with a stub resolver
	library that sends recursive DNS queries to a local caching name
	server.
      </para>
      <para>
	At first, IPv6 introduced new complexity into the resolution process,
	such as following A6 chains and DNAME records, and simultaneous
	lookup of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Though most of the complexity was
	then removed, these are hard or impossible
	to implement in a traditional stub resolver.
      </para>
      <para>
	<acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 therefore can also provide resolution
	services to local clients
	using a combination of a lightweight resolver library and a resolver
	daemon process running on the local host.  These communicate using
	a simple UDP-based protocol, the "lightweight resolver protocol,"
	that is distinct from and simpler than the full DNS protocol.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="lwresd"><info><title>Running a Resolver Daemon</title></info>

      <para>
	To use the lightweight resolver interface, the system must
	run the resolver daemon <command>lwresd</command> or a
	local

	statement.
      </para>

      <para>
	By default, applications using the lightweight resolver library
	make
	UDP requests to the IPv4 loopback address (127.0.0.1) on port 921.
	The
	address can be overridden by <command>lwserver</command>
	lines in
	<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The <command>lwresd</command> daemon is essentially a
	caching-only name server that responds to requests using the
	lightweight
	resolver protocol rather than the DNS protocol.  Because it needs
	to run on each host, it is designed to require no or minimal
	configuration.
	Unless otherwise instructed, it uses the name servers listed on
	<command>nameserver</command> lines in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>
	as forwarders, but is also capable of doing the resolution
	autonomously if
	none are specified.
      </para>

	  <para>
	    Address match lists are primarily used to determine access
	    control for various server operations. They are also used in
	    the <command>listen-on</command> and <command>sortlist</command>
	    statements. The elements which constitute an address match
	    list can be any of the following:
	  </para>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)</simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>an IP prefix (in "/" notation)</simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>
		a key ID, as defined by the <command>key</command>
		statement
	      </simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>the name of an address match list defined with
		the <command>acl</command> statement
	      </simpara>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <simpara>a nested address match list enclosed in braces</simpara>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>
	    Elements can be negated with a leading exclamation mark ("!"),
	    and the match list names "any", "none", "localhost", and
	    "localnets" are predefined. More information on those names
	    can be found in the description of the <command>acl</command>
	    statement.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The addition of the key clause made the name of this syntactic
	    element something of a misnomer, since security keys can be used
	    to validate access without regard to a host or network address.
	    Nonetheless, the term "address match list" is still used
	    throughout the documentation.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When a given IP address or prefix is compared to an address
	    match list, the comparison takes place in approximately O(1)
	    time.  However, key comparisons require that the list of keys
	    be traversed until a matching key is found, and therefore may
	    be somewhat slower.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The interpretation of a match depends on whether the list is being
	    used for access control, defining <command>listen-on</command> ports, or in a
	    <command>sortlist</command>, and whether the element was negated.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When used as an access control list, a non-negated match
	    allows access and a negated match denies access. If
	    there is no match, access is denied. The clauses
	    <command>allow-notify</command>,
	    <command>allow-recursion</command>,
	    <command>allow-recursion-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-query</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-cache</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-cache-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-transfer</command>,
	    <command>allow-update</command>,
	    <command>allow-update-forwarding</command>,
	    <command>blackhole</command>, and
	    <command>keep-response-order</command> all use address match
	    lists.  Similarly, the <command>listen-on</command> option causes the
	    server to refuse queries on any of the machine's
	    addresses which do not match the list.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Order of insertion is significant.  If more than one element
	    in an ACL is found to match a given IP address or prefix,
	    preference is given to the one that came
	    <emphasis>first</emphasis> in the ACL definition.
	    Because of this first-match behavior, an element that
	    defines a subset of another element in the list should
	    come before the broader element, regardless of whether
	    either is negated. For example, in
	    <command>1.2.3/24; ! 1.2.3.13;</command>
	    the 1.2.3.13 element is completely useless because the
	    algorithm matches any lookup for 1.2.3.13 to the 1.2.3/24
	    element.  Using <command>! 1.2.3.13; 1.2.3/24</command> fixes
	    that problem by blocking 1.2.3.13 via the negation, but
	    all other 1.2.3.* hosts pass through.

	<para>
	  The <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 comment syntax allows

	  <para>
	    Comments may appear anywhere that whitespace may appear in
	    a <acronym>BIND</acronym> configuration file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    C-style comments start with the two characters /* (slash,
	    star) and end with */ (star, slash). Because they are completely
	    delimited with these characters, they can be used to comment only
	    a portion of a line or to span multiple lines.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    C-style comments cannot be nested. For example, the following
	    is not valid because the entire comment ends with the first */:
	  </para>
	  <para>

<programlisting>/* This is the start of a comment.
   This is still part of the comment.
/* This is an incorrect attempt at nesting a comment. */
   This is no longer in any comment. */
</programlisting>

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    C++-style comments start with the two characters // (slash,
	    slash) and continue to the end of the physical line. They cannot
	    be continued across multiple physical lines; to have one logical
	    comment span multiple lines, each line must use the // pair.
	    For example:
	  </para>
	  <para>

<programlisting>// This is the start of a comment.  The next line
// is a new comment, even though it is logically
// part of the previous comment.
</programlisting>

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Shell-style (or perl-style) comments start
	    with the character <literal>#</literal> (number sign)
	    and continue to the end of the
	    physical line, as in C++ comments.
	    For example:
	  </para>

	  <para>

<programlisting># This is the start of a comment.  The next line
# is a new comment, even though it is logically
# part of the previous comment.
</programlisting>

	  </para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>

	  Usage</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>controls</command> statement declares control
	  channels to be used by system administrators to manage the
	  operation of the name server. These control channels are
	  used by the <command>rndc</command> utility to send
	  commands to and retrieve non-DNS results from a name server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An <command>inet</command> control channel is a TCP socket
	  listening at the specified <command>ip_port</command> on the
	  specified <command>ip_addr</command>, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6
	  address.  An <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>*</literal> (asterisk) is
	  interpreted as the IPv4 wildcard address; connections are
	  accepted on any of the system's IPv4 addresses.
	  To listen on the IPv6 wildcard address,
	  use an <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>::</literal>.
	  If <command>rndc</command> is only used on the local host,
	  using the loopback address (<literal>127.0.0.1</literal>
	  or <literal>::1</literal>) is recommended for maximum security.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no port is specified, port 953 is used. The asterisk
	  "<literal>*</literal>" cannot be used for <command>ip_port</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The ability to issue commands over the control channel is
	  restricted by the <command>allow</command> and
	  <command>keys</command> clauses.
	  Connections to the control channel are permitted based on the
	  <command>address_match_list</command>.  This is for simple
	  IP address-based filtering only; any <command>key_id</command>
	  elements of the <command>address_match_list</command>
	  are ignored.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A <command>unix</command> control channel is a Unix domain
	  socket listening at the specified path in the file system.
	  Access to the socket is specified by the <command>perm</command>,
	  <command>owner</command>, and <command>group</command> clauses.
	  Note on some platforms (SunOS and Solaris), the permissions
	  (<command>perm</command>) are applied to the parent directory
	  as the permissions on the socket itself are ignored.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The primary authorization mechanism of the command
	  channel is the <command>key_list</command>, which
	  contains a list of <command>key_id</command>s.
	  Each <command>key_id</command> in the <command>key_list</command>
	  is authorized to execute commands over the control channel.
	  See <xref linkend="rndc"/> in <xref linkend="admin_tools"/>)
	  for information about configuring keys in <command>rndc</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If the <command>read-only</command> clause is enabled, the
	  control channel is limited to the following set of read-only
	  commands: <command>nta -dump</command>,
	  <command>null</command>, <command>status</command>,
	  <command>showzone</command>, <command>testgen</command>, and
	  <command>zonestatus</command>. By default,
	  <command>read-only</command> is not enabled and the control
	  channel allows read-write access.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no <command>controls</command> statement is present,
	  <command>named</command> sets up a default
	  control channel listening on the loopback address 127.0.0.1
	  and its IPv6 counterpart ::1.
	  In this case, and also when the <command>controls</command> statement
	  is present but does not have a <command>keys</command> clause,
	  <command>named</command> attempts to load the command channel key
	  from the file <filename>rndc.key</filename> in
	  <filename>/etc</filename> (or whatever <varname>sysconfdir</varname>
	  was specified when <acronym>BIND</acronym> was built).
	  To create an <filename>rndc.key</filename> file, run
	  <userinput>rndc-confgen -a</userinput>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The key name and the size of the secret cannot be easily changed; if it
	  is desirable to change those things, make a
	  <filename>rndc.conf</filename> with a custom key.  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> file
	  also has its
	  permissions set such that only the owner of the file (the user that
	  <command>named</command> is running as) can access it.
	  For greater flexibility in allowing other users to access
	  <command>rndc</command> commands, create
	  a
	  <filename>rndc.conf</filename> file and make it group-readable by a group
	  that contains the users who should have access.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To disable the command channel, use an empty
	  <command>controls</command> statement:
	  <command>controls { };</command>.

      <section xml:id="logging_statement"><info><title><command>logging</command> Statement Definition and Usage</title></info>

	<para>
	  The <command>logging</command> statement configures a
	  wide
	  variety of logging options for the name server. Its <command>channel</command> phrase
	  associates output methods, format options, and severity levels with
	  a name that can then be used with the <command>category</command> phrase
	  to select how various classes of messages are logged.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Only one <command>logging</command> statement is used to
	  define
	  as many channels and categories as desired. If there is no <command>logging</command> statement,
	  the logging configuration is:
	</para>

<programlisting>logging {
     category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
     category unmatched { null; };
};
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  If <command>named</command> is started with the
	  <option>-L</option> option, it logs to the specified file
	  at startup, instead of using syslog. In this case the logging
	  configuration is:
	</para>

<programlisting>logging {
     category default { default_logfile; default_debug; };
     category unmatched { null; };
};
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  The logging configuration
	  is only established when
	  the entire configuration file has been parsed. When the server starts up, all logging messages
	  regarding syntax errors in the configuration file go to the default
	  channels, or to standard error if the <option>-g</option> option
	  was specified.
	</para>

	<section xml:id="channel"><info><title>The <command>channel</command> Phrase</title></info>

	  <para>
	    All log output goes to one or more <emphasis>channels</emphasis>;
	    there is no limit to the number of channels that can be created.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Every channel definition must include a destination clause that
	    says whether messages selected for the channel go to a file, go to a
	    particular syslog facility, go to the standard error stream, or are
	    discarded. The definition can optionally also limit the message severity level
	    that is accepted by the channel (the default is
	    <command>info</command>), and whether to include a
	    <command>named</command>-generated time stamp, the
	    category name,
	    and/or the severity level (the default is not to include any).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>null</command> destination clause
	    causes all messages sent to the channel to be discarded;
	    in that case, other options for the channel are meaningless.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>file</command> destination clause directs
	    the channel
	    to a disk file.  It can include limitations
	    both on how large the file is allowed to become, and on how many
	    versions
	    of the file are saved each time the file is opened.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If the <command>versions</command> log file
	    option is used, then
	    <command>named</command> retains that many backup
	    versions of the file by
	    renaming them when opening.  For example, to keep
	    three old versions
	    of the file <filename>lamers.log</filename>, just
	    before it is opened
	    <filename>lamers.log.1</filename> is renamed to
	    <filename>lamers.log.2</filename>, <filename>lamers.log.0</filename> is renamed
	    to <filename>lamers.log.1</filename>, and <filename>lamers.log</filename> is
	    renamed to <filename>lamers.log.0</filename>.
	    The <command>versions unlimited</command> option can be set to
	    not limit
	    the number of versions.
	    If a <command>size</command> option is associated with
	    the log file,
	    then renaming is only done when the file being opened exceeds the
	    indicated size.  No backup versions are kept by default; any
	    existing
	    log file is simply appended.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>size</command> option for files is used
	    to limit log
	    growth. If the file ever exceeds the size, then <command>named</command>
	    stops writing to the file unless it also has a <command>versions</command> option
	    associated with it.  If backup versions are kept, the files are
	    rolled as
	    described above and a new one begun.  If there is no
	    <command>versions</command> option, no more data is
	    written to the log
	    until some out-of-band mechanism removes or truncates the log to
	    less than the
	    maximum size.  The default behavior is not to limit the size of
	    the
	    file.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Here is an example using the <command>size</command> and
	    <command>versions</command> options:
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel an_example_channel {
    file "example.log" versions 3 size 20m;
    print-time yes;
    print-category yes;
};
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    The <command>syslog</command> destination clause
	    directs the
	    channel to the system log.  Its argument is a
	    syslog facility as described in the <command>syslog</command> man
	    page. Known facilities are <command>kern</command>, <command>user</command>,
	    <command>mail</command>, <command>daemon</command>, <command>auth</command>,
	    <command>syslog</command>, <command>lpr</command>, <command>news</command>,
	    <command>uucp</command>, <command>cron</command>, <command>authpriv</command>,
	    <command>ftp</command>, <command>local0</command>, <command>local1</command>,
	    <command>local2</command>, <command>local3</command>, <command>local4</command>,
	    <command>local5</command>, <command>local6</command>, and
	    <command>local7</command>; however, not all facilities
	    are supported on
	    all operating systems.
	    How <command>syslog</command> handles messages
	    sent to
	    this facility is described in the <command>syslog.conf</command> man
	    page. On a system which uses a very old version of <command>syslog</command>, which
	    only uses two arguments to the <command>openlog()</command> function,
	    then this clause is silently ignored.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    On Windows machines, syslog messages are directed to the EventViewer.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <command>severity</command> clause works like <command>syslog</command>'s
	    "priorities," except that they can also be used when writing
	    straight to a file rather than using <command>syslog</command>.
	    Messages which are not at least of the severity level given are
	    not selected for the channel; messages of higher severity
	    levels
	    are accepted.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    When using <command>syslog</command>, the <command>syslog.conf</command> priorities
	    also determine what eventually passes through. For example,
	    defining a channel facility and severity as <command>daemon</command> and <command>debug</command>, but
	    only logging <command>daemon.warning</command> via <command>syslog.conf</command>,
	    causes messages of severity <command>info</command> and
	    <command>notice</command> to
	    be dropped. If the situation were reversed, with <command>named</command> writing
	    messages of only <command>warning</command> or higher,
	    then <command>syslogd</command> would
	    print all messages it received from the channel.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>stderr</command> destination clause
	    directs the
	    channel to the server's standard error stream.  This is intended
	    for
	    use when the server is running as a foreground process, as
	    when debugging a configuration, for example.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The server can supply extensive debugging information when
	    it is in debugging mode. If the server's global debug level is
	    greater
	    than zero, debugging mode is active. The global debug
	    level is set either by starting the <command>named</command> server
	    with the <option>-d</option> flag followed by a positive integer,
	    or by running <command>rndc trace</command>.
	    The global debug level
	    can be set to zero, and debugging mode turned off, by running <command>rndc
		notrace</command>. All debugging messages in the server have a debug
	    level; higher debug levels give more detailed output. Channels
	    that specify a specific debug severity, for example:
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel specific_debug_level {
    file "foo";
    severity debug 3;
};
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    get debugging output of level 3 or less any time the
	    server is in debugging mode, regardless of the global debugging
	    level. Channels with <command>dynamic</command>
	    severity use the
	    server's global debug level to determine what messages to print.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If <command>print-time</command> is set to
	    <userinput>yes</userinput>, then the date and time are logged.
	    <command>print-time</command> may be specified for a
	    <command>syslog</command> channel, but is usually
	    unnecessary since <command>syslog</command> also logs
	    the date and time. If <command>print-category</command> is
	    set to <userinput>yes</userinput>, then the
	    category of the message is logged as well. Finally, if
	    <command>print-severity</command> is set, then the severity
	    level of the message is logged.
	    The <command>print-</command> options may
	    be used in any combination, and are always printed in the
	    following
	    order: time, category, severity. Here is an example where all
	    three <command>print-</command> options
	    are on:
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>28-Feb-2000 15:05:32.863 general: notice: running</computeroutput>
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If <command>buffered</command> has been turned on, the output
	    to files is not flushed after each log entry.  By default
	    all log messages are flushed.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    There are four predefined channels that are used for
	    <command>named</command>'s default logging, as follows.
	    If <command>named</command> is started with the
	    <option>-L</option>, then a
	    fifth channel, <command>default_logfile</command>, is added.
	    How they are
	    used is described in <xref linkend="the_category_phrase"/>.
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel default_syslog {
    // send to syslog's daemon facility
    syslog daemon;
    // only send priority info and higher
    severity info;
};

channel default_debug {
    // write to named.run in the working directory
    // Note: stderr is used instead of "named.run" if
    // the server is started with the '-g' option.
    file "named.run";
    // log at the server's current debug level
    severity dynamic;
};

channel default_stderr {
    // writes to stderr
    stderr;
    // only send priority info and higher
    severity info;
};

channel null {
   // toss anything sent to this channel
   null;
};

channel default_logfile {
    // this channel is only present if named is
    // started with the -L option, whose argument
    // provides the file name
    file "...";
    // log at the server's current debug level
    severity dynamic;
};
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    The <command>default_debug</command> channel has the
	    special
	    property that it only produces output when the server's debug
	    level is
	    non-zero.  It normally writes to a file called <filename>named.run</filename>
	    in the server's working directory.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    For security reasons, when the <option>-u</option>
	    command-line option is used, the <filename>named.run</filename> file
	    is created only after <command>named</command> has
	    changed to the
	    new UID, and any debug output generated while <command>named</command> is
	    starting - and still running as root - is discarded.
	    To capture this output, run the server with the <option>-L</option>
	    option to specify a default logfile, or the <option>-g</option>
	    option to log to standard error which can be redirected to a file.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Once a channel is defined, it cannot be redefined.
	    The built-in channels cannot be altered directly, but
	    the default logging can be modified by pointing categories at defined channels.
	  </para>
	</section>

	<section xml:id="the_category_phrase"><info><title>The <command>category</command> Phrase</title></info>

	  <para>
	    There are many categories, so desired logs
	    can be sent anywhere while unwanted logs are ignored. If
	    a list of channels is not specified for a category, log
	    messages
	    in that category are sent to the <command>default</command> category
	    instead. If no default category is specified, the following
	    "default default" is used:
	  </para>

<programlisting>category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If <command>named</command> is started with the
	    <option>-L</option> option, the default category is:
	  </para>

<programlisting>category default { default_logfile; default_debug; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    As an example, let's say a user wants to log security events to
	    a file, but also wants to keep the default logging behavior. They would
	    specify the following:
	  </para>

<programlisting>channel my_security_channel {
    file "my_security_file";
    severity info;
};
category security {
    my_security_channel;
    default_syslog;
    default_debug;
};</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    To discard all messages in a category, specify the <command>null</command> channel:
	  </para>

<programlisting>category xfer-out { null; };
category notify { null; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    The following are the available categories and brief descriptions
	    of the types of log information they contain. More
	    categories may be added in future <acronym>BIND</acronym> releases.
	  </para>
	  <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="logging-categories.xml"/>
	</section>
	<section xml:id="query_errors"><info><title>The <command>query-errors</command> Category</title></info>
	  <para>
	    The <command>query-errors</command> category is
	    used to indicate why and how specific queries resulted in
	    responses which indicate an error.  Normally, these messages
	    will be logged at <command>debug</command> logging levels;
	    note, however, that if query logging is active, some are
	    logged at <command>info</command>. The logging levels are
	    described below:
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    At <command>debug</command> level 1 or higher - or at
	    <command>info</command>, when query logging is active - each
	    response with response code SERVFAIL is logged as follows:
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>client 127.0.0.1#61502: query failed (SERVFAIL) for www.example.com/IN/AAAA at query.c:3880</computeroutput>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This means an error resulting in SERVFAIL was detected at line
	    3880 of source file <filename>query.c</filename>.  Log messages
	    of this level are particularly helpful in identifying the cause of
	    SERVFAIL for an authoritative server.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    At <command>debug</command> level 2 or higher, detailed
	    context information about recursive resolutions that resulted in
	    SERVFAIL is logged.  The log message looks like this:
	  </para>
	  <para>
<!-- NOTE: newlines and some spaces added so this would fit on page -->
	    <programlisting>
fetch completed at resolver.c:2970 for www.example.com/A
in 10.000183: timed out/success [domain:example.com,
referral:2,restart:7,qrysent:8,timeout:5,lame:0,quota:0,neterr:0,
badresp:1,adberr:0,findfail:0,valfail:0]
	    </programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The first part before the colon shows that a recursive
	    resolution for AAAA records of www.example.com completed
	    in 10.000183 seconds, and the final result that led to the
	    SERVFAIL was determined at line 2970 of source file
	    <filename>resolver.c</filename>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The next part shows the detected final result and the
	    latest result of DNSSEC validation.  The latter is always
	    "success" when no validation attempt was made.  In this example,
	    this query probably resulted in SERVFAIL because all name
	    servers are down or unreachable, leading to a timeout in 10
	    seconds.  DNSSEC validation was probably not attempted.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The last part, enclosed in square brackets, shows statistics
	    collected for this particular resolution attempt.
	    The <varname>domain</varname> field shows the deepest zone that
	    the resolver reached; it is the zone where the error was
	    finally detected.  The meaning of the other fields is
	    summarized in the following table.

	  <xref linkend="lwresd"/>.)  There may be multiple
	  <command>lwres</command> statements configuring
	  lightweight resolver servers with different properties.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <command>listen-on</command> statement specifies a
	  list of
	  IPv4 addresses (and ports) that this instance of a lightweight
	  resolver daemon
	  should accept requests on.  If no port is specified, port 921 is
	  used.
	  If this statement is omitted, requests are accepted on
	  127.0.0.1,
	  port 921.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <command>view</command> statement binds this
	  instance of a
	  lightweight resolver daemon to a view in the DNS namespace, so that
	  the
	  response is constructed in the same manner as a normal DNS
	  query
	  matching this view.  If this statement is omitted, the default view
	  is
	  used; if there is no default view, an error is triggered.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <command>search</command> statement is equivalent to
	  the

	<para>
	  The <command>ndots</command> statement is equivalent to

	<para>
	  The <option>lwres-tasks</option> statement specifies the number

	  command-line option when starting the server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <option>lwres-clients</option> statement specifies

	<para>
	  The <command>options</command> statement sets up global
	  options
	  to be used by <acronym>BIND</acronym>. This statement
	  may appear only
	  once in a configuration file. If there is no <command>options</command>

	<variablelist>

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term><command>attach-cache</command></term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  This option allows multiple views to share a single cache
		  database.
		  Each view has its own cache database by default, but
		  if multiple views have the same operational policy
		  for name resolution and caching, those views can
		  share a single cache to save memory, and possibly
		  improve resolution efficiency, by using this option.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <command>attach-cache</command> option
		  may also be specified in <command>view</command>
		  statements, in which case it overrides the
		  global <command>attach-cache</command> option.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The <replaceable>cache_name</replaceable> specifies
		  the cache to be shared.
		  When the <command>named</command> server configures
		  views which are supposed to share a cache, it
		  creates a cache with the specified name for the
		  first view of these sharing views.
		  The rest of the views simply refer to the
		  already-created cache.
		</para>

		<para>
		  One common configuration to share a cache is to
		  allow all views to share a single cache.
		  This can be done by specifying
		  <command>attach-cache</command> as a global
		  option with an arbitrary name.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Another possible operation is to allow a subset of
		  all views to share a cache while the others
		  retain their own caches.
		  For example, if there are three views A, B, and C,
		  and only A and B should share a cache, specify the
		  <command>attach-cache</command> option as a view of A (or
		  B)'s option, referring to the other view name:
		</para>

<programlisting>
  view "A" {
    // this view has its own cache
    ...
  };
  view "B" {
    // this view refers to A's cache
    attach-cache "A";
  };
  view "C" {
    // this view has its own cache
    ...
  };
</programlisting>

		<para>
		  Views that share a cache must have the same policy
		  on configurable parameters that may affect caching.
		  The current implementation requires the following
		  configurable options be consistent among these
		  views:
		  <command>check-names</command>,
		  <command>cleaning-interval</command>,
		  <command>dnssec-accept-expired</command>,
		  <command>dnssec-validation</command>,
		  <command>max-cache-ttl</command>,
		  <command>max-ncache-ttl</command>,
		  <command>max-cache-size</command>, and
		  <command>zero-no-soa-ttl</command>.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Note that there may be other parameters that may
		  cause confusion if they are inconsistent for
		  different views that share a single cache.
		  For example, if these views define different sets of
		  forwarders that can return different answers for the
		  same question, sharing the answer does not make
		  sense or could even be harmful.
		  It is administrator's responsibility to ensure that
		  configuration differences in different views do
		  not cause disruption with a shared cache.

		DS queries are expected to be made to and be answered by

		If a delegation-only zone server also serves a child

		child zone.  SOA NS and DNSKEY records are apex-only
		records and a matching response that contains
		these records or DS is treated as coming from a
		child zone.  RRSIG records are also examined to see
		if they are signed by a child zone, and the
		authority section is examined to see if there
		is evidence that the answer is from the child zone.
		Answers that are determined to be from a child zone
		are not converted to NXDOMAIN responses.  Despite
		all these checks, there is still a possibility of
		false negatives when a child zone is being served.

		<para>
		  These options control the behavior of an authoritative
		  server when
		  answering queries which have additional data, or when
		  following CNAME
		  and DNAME chains.
		</para>

		<para>
		  When both of these options are set to <userinput>yes</userinput>
		  (the default) and a
		  query is being answered from authoritative data (a zone
		  configured into the server), the additional data section of
		  the
		  reply is filled in using data from other authoritative
		  zones
		  and from the cache.  In some situations this is undesirable,
		  such
		  as when there is concern over the correctness of the cache,
		  or
		  in servers where secondary zones may be added and modified by
		  untrusted third parties.  Also, avoiding
		  the search for this additional data speeds up server
		  operations
		  at the possible expense of additional queries to resolve
		  what would
		  otherwise be provided in the additional section.
		</para>

		<para>
		  For example, if a query asks for an MX record for host <literal>foo.example.com</literal>,
		  and the record found is "<literal>MX 10 mail.example.net</literal>", normally the address
		  records (A and AAAA) for <literal>mail.example.net</literal> are provided as well,
		  if known, even though they are not in the example.com zone.
		  Setting these options to <command>no</command>
		  disables this behavior and makes
		  the server only search for additional data in the zone it
		  answers from.
		</para>

		<para>
		  These options are intended for use in authoritative-only
		  servers, or in authoritative-only views.  Attempts to set
		  them to <command>no</command> without also
		  specifying
		  <command>recursion no</command> will cause the
		  server to
		  ignore the options and log a warning message.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Specifying <command>additional-from-cache no</command> actually
		  disables the use of the cache not only for additional data
		  lookups
		  but also when looking up the answer.  This is usually the
		  desired
		  behavior in an authoritative-only server where the
		  correctness of
		  the cached data is an issue.
		</para>

		<para>
		  When a name server is non-recursively queried for a name
		  that is not
		  below the apex of any served zone, it normally answers with
		  an
		  "upwards referral" to the root servers or the servers of
		  some other
		  known parent of the query name.  Since the data in an
		  upwards referral
		  comes from the cache, the server is not able to provide
		  upwards
		  referrals when <command>additional-from-cache no</command>
		  has been specified.  Instead, it responds to such
		  queries
		  with REFUSED.  This should not cause any problems since
		  upwards referrals are not required for the resolution
		  process.

		  This option was introduced to work around a kernel quirk

		  This option is only available when

		  to DNS clients unless they have connections to the IPv6
		  Internet.  This is not recommended unless absolutely

		</para>
		<para>
		  If <userinput>break-dnssec</userinput>,

		  When <userinput>yes</userinput> and the server loads a new

		</para>
		<para>
		  By allowing incremental zone transfers to be used for
		  non-dynamic zones, this option saves bandwidth at the
		  expense of increased CPU and memory consumption at the
		  primary server.
		  In particular, if the new version of a zone is completely
		  different from the previous one, the set of differences
		  is of a size comparable to the combined size of the

	    cache on a few servers, reducing traffic over links to external
	    name servers. It can also be used to allow queries by servers that
	    do not have direct access to the Internet, but wish to look up
	    exterior
	    names anyway. Forwarding occurs only on those queries for which
	    the server is not authoritative and does not have the answer in
	    its cache.

		<para>
		  This can result in slightly smaller responses; if

		  that the case of the query name exactly matches the
		  case of the owner names of returned records, rather

		  of the name that was used in the zone file.  This
		  limitation may be addressed in a future release.  However,

	  <para>
	    The interfaces and ports that the server answers queries

	    of IPv4 addresses.  (IPv6 addresses are ignored, with a

	    The server listens on all interfaces allowed by the address

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Multiple <command>listen-on</command> statements are

listen-on port 1234 { !1.2.3.4; 1.2/16; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    enables the name server on port 53 for the IP address
	    5.6.7.8, and on port 1234 of an address on the machine in net

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If no <command>listen-on</command> is specified, the
	    server listens on port 53 on all IPv4 interfaces.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>listen-on-v6</command> option is used to
	    specify the interfaces and the ports on which the server

	    the server listens on port 53 on all IPv6 interfaces.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When <programlisting>{ any; }</programlisting> is
	    specified
	    as the <varname>address_match_list</varname> for the
	    <command>listen-on-v6</command> option,
	    the server does not bind a separate socket to each IPv6 interface
	    address as it does for IPv4, if the operating system has enough API
	    support for IPv6 (specifically, if it conforms to RFC 3493 and RFC
	    3542).
	    Instead, it listens on the IPv6 wildcard address.
	    If the system only has incomplete API support for IPv6, however,
	    the behavior is the same as that for IPv4.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A list of particular IPv6 addresses can also be specified, in
	    which case
	    the server listens on a separate socket for each specified
	    address,
	    regardless of whether the desired API is supported by the system.
	    IPv4 addresses specified in <command>listen-on-v6</command>
	    are ignored, with a logged warning.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Multiple <command>listen-on-v6</command> options can

	    For example:
	  </para>

<programlisting>listen-on-v6 { any; };
listen-on-v6 port 1234 { !2001:db8::/32; any; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    enables the name server on port 53 for any IPv6 addresses
	    (with a single wildcard socket),
	    and on port 1234 of IPv6 addresses that are not in the prefix
	    2001:db8::/32 (with separate sockets for each matched address).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    To instruct the server not to listen on any IPv6 address, use:

<programlisting>listen-on-v6 { none; };

	<section xml:id="query_address"><info><title>Query Address</title></info>

	  <para>
	    If the server does not know the answer to a question, it
	    queries other name servers. <command>query-source</command> specifies
	    the address and port used for such queries. For queries sent over
	    IPv6, there is a separate <command>query-source-v6</command> option.
	    If <command>address</command> is <command>*</command> (asterisk) or is omitted,
	    a wildcard IP address (<command>INADDR_ANY</command>)
	    is used.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If <command>port</command> is <command>*</command> or is omitted,
	    a random port number from a pre-configured
	    range is picked up and used for each query.
	    The port range(s) is specified in
	    the <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> (for IPv4)
	    and <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> (for IPv6)
	    options, excluding the ranges specified in
	    the <command>avoid-v4-udp-ports</command>
	    and <command>avoid-v6-udp-ports</command> options, respectively.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The defaults of the <command>query-source</command> and
	    <command>query-source-v6</command> options
	    are:
	  </para>

<programlisting>query-source address * port *;
query-source-v6 address * port *;
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> or
	    <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> is unspecified,
	    <command>named</command> checks whether the operating
	    system provides a programming interface to retrieve the
	    system's default range for ephemeral ports.
	    If such an interface is available,
	    <command>named</command> uses the corresponding system
	    default range; otherwise, it uses its own defaults:
	 </para>

<programlisting>use-v4-udp-ports { range 1024 65535; };
use-v6-udp-ports { range 1024 65535; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    Note: make sure the ranges are sufficiently large for
	    security.  A desirable size depends on several parameters,
	    but we generally recommend it contain at least 16384 ports
	    (14 bits of entropy).
	    Note also that the system's default range when used may be
	    too small for this purpose, and that the range may even be
	    changed while <command>named</command> is running; the new
	    range is automatically applied when <command>named</command>
	    is reloaded.
	    Explicit
	    configuration of <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> and
	    <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> is encouraged, so that the
	    ranges are sufficiently large and are reasonably
	    independent from the ranges used by other applications.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note: the operational configuration
	    where <command>named</command> runs may prohibit the use
	    of some ports.  For example, Unix systems do not allow
	    <command>named</command>, if run without root privilege,
	    to use ports less than 1024.
	    If such ports are included in the specified (or detected)
	    set of query ports, the corresponding query attempts will
	    fail, resulting in resolution failures or delay.
	    It is therefore important to configure the set of ports
	    that can be safely used in the expected operational environment.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The defaults of the <command>avoid-v4-udp-ports</command> and

	    and set limits on the amount of load that transfers place on the
	    system. The following options apply to zone transfers.

	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  This option defines a global list of IP addresses of name servers
		  that are also sent NOTIFY messages whenever a fresh copy of
		  the
		  zone is loaded, in addition to the servers listed in the
		  zone's NS records.
		  This helps to ensure that copies of the zones
		  quickly converge on stealth servers.
		  Optionally, a port may be specified with each
		  <command>also-notify</command> address to send
		  the notify messages to a port other than the
		  default of 53.
		  An optional TSIG key can also be specified with each
		  address to cause the notify messages to be signed; this
		  can be useful when sending notifies to multiple views.
		  In place of explicit addresses, one or more named
		  <command>masters</command> lists can be used.
		</para>
		<para>
		  If an <command>also-notify</command> list
		  is given in a <command>zone</command> statement,
		  it overrides
		  the <command>options also-notify</command>
		  statement. When a <command>zone notify</command>
		  statement
		  is set to <command>no</command>, the IP
		  addresses in the global <command>also-notify</command> list are
		  not sent NOTIFY messages for that zone. The default is
		  the empty
		  list (no global notification list).

		<para>
		  Zone transfers can be sent using two different formats,

		  <command>many-answers</command>.
		  The <command>transfer-format</command> option is used
		  on the primary server to determine which format it sends.
		  <command>one-answer</command> uses one DNS message per
		  resource record transferred.
		  <command>many-answers</command> packs as many resource
		  records as possible into one message.
		  <command>many-answers</command> is more efficient; the default is <command>many-answers</command>.
		  The <command>many-answers</command> format is also supported by
		  recent Microsoft Windows name servers.
		  <command>transfer-format</command> may be overridden on a
		  per-server basis by using the <command>server</command>

	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  This is an upper bound on the uncompressed size of DNS
		  messages used in zone transfers over TCP.  If a message
		  grows larger than this size, additional messages are
		  used to complete the zone transfer.  (Note, however,
		  that this is a hint, not a hard limit; if a message
		  contains a single resource record whose RDATA does not
		  fit within the size limit, a larger message will be
		  permitted so the record can be transferred.)
		</para>
		<para>
		  Valid values are between 512 and 65535 octets; any
		  values outside that range are adjusted to the nearest
		  value within it.  The default is <literal>20480</literal>,
		  which was selected to improve message compression;
		  most DNS messages of this size will compress to less
		  than 16536 bytes.  Larger messages cannot be compressed
		  as effectively, because 16536 is the largest permissible
		  compression offset pointer in a DNS message.
		</para>
		<para>
		  This option is mainly intended for server testing;
		  there is rarely any benefit in setting a value other
		  than the default.

	   <para>
	     <command>avoid-v4-udp-ports</command> and

		<para>
		  The first argument is an integer value indicating
		  how frequently to recalculate the moving average

		  The remaining three arguments represent the "low"
		  threshold (defaulting to a timeout ratio of 0.1),
		  the "high" threshold (defaulting to a timeout
		  ratio of 0.3), and the discount rate for
		  the moving average (defaulting to 0.7).
		  A higher discount rate causes recent events to
		  weigh more heavily when calculating the moving
		  average; a lower discount rate causes past
		  events to weigh more heavily, smoothing out
		  short-term blips in the timeout ratio.
		  These arguments are all fixed-point numbers with
		  precision of 1/100; at most two places after

		  This sets the maximum amount of memory to use for the

		  The keyword <userinput>unlimited</userinput>,
		  or the value 0, places no limit on the cache size;
		  records are purged from the cache only when their

		  Any positive values less than 2MB are ignored
		  and reset to 2MB.
		  In a server with multiple views, the limit applies
		  separately to the cache of each view.
		  The default is <userinput>90%</userinput>.
		  On systems where detection of the amount of physical
		  memory is not supported, values represented as a percentage
		  fall back to unlimited.
		  Note that the detection of physical memory is done only

	<section xml:id="the_sortlist_statement"><info><title>The <command>sortlist</command> Statement</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The response to a DNS query may consist of multiple resource
	    records (RRs) forming a resource record set (RRset).  The name
	    server normally returns the RRs within the RRset in an
	    indeterminate order (but see the <command>rrset-order</command>
	    statement in <xref linkend="rrset_ordering"/>).  The client
	    resolver code should rearrange the RRs as appropriate: that is,
	    using any addresses on the local net in preference to other
	    addresses.  However, not all resolvers can do this or are
	    correctly configured.  When a client is using a local server,
	    the sorting can be performed in the server, based on the
	    client's address. This only requires configuring the name
	    servers, not all the clients.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>sortlist</command> statement (see below) takes an
	    <command>address_match_list</command> and interprets it in a
	    special way.  Each top-level statement in the
	    <command>sortlist</command> must itself be an explicit
	    <command>address_match_list</command> with one or two elements.
	    The first element (which may be an IP address, an IP prefix, an
	    ACL name, or a nested <command>address_match_list</command>) of
	    each top-level list is checked against the source address of
	    the query until a match is found. When the addresses in the
	    first element overlap, the first rule to match is selected.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Once the source address of the query has been matched, if the
	    top-level statement contains only one element, the actual
	    primitive element that matched the source address is used to
	    select the address in the response to move to the beginning of
	    the response. If the statement is a list of two elements, then
	    the second element is interpreted as a topology preference
	    list.  Each top-level element is assigned a distance, and the
	    address in the response with the minimum distance is moved to
	    the beginning of the response.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In the following example, any queries received from any of the
	    addresses of the host itself get responses preferring
	    addresses on any of the locally connected networks. Next most
	    preferred are addresses on the 192.168.1/24 network, and after
	    that either the 192.168.2/24 or 192.168.3/24 network, with no
	    preference shown between these two networks. Queries received
	    from a host on the 192.168.1/24 network prefer other
	    addresses on that network to the 192.168.2/24 and 192.168.3/24
	    networks. Queries received from a host on the 192.168.4/24 or
	    the 192.168.5/24 network only prefer other addresses on
	    their directly connected networks.

		<para>
		  This sets the maximum advertised EDNS UDP buffer size, in

		</para>
		<para>
		  The usual reason for setting

		  is to get UDP answers to pass through broken firewalls
		  that block fragmented packets and/or block UDP DNS
		  packets that are greater than 512 bytes.
		</para>
		<para>
		  When <command>named</command> first queries a remote
		  server, it advertises a UDP buffer size of 512, as
		  this has the greatest chance of success on the first try.
		</para>
		<para>
		  If the initial response times out, <command>named</command>
		  tries again with plain DNS; if that is successful,
		  it is taken as evidence that the server does not
		  support EDNS. After enough failures using EDNS and
		  successes using plain DNS, <command>named</command>
		  defaults to plain DNS for future communications
		  with that server.  If that happens, <command>named</command>
		  periodically sends an EDNS query to see if the situation has
		  improved.
		</para>
		<para>
		  However, if the initial query is successful with
		  EDNS advertising a buffer size of 512, then
		  <command>named</command> advertises progressively
		  larger buffer sizes on successive queries, until
		  responses begin timing out or
		  <command>edns-udp-size</command> is reached.
		</para>
		<para>
		  The default buffer sizes used by <command>named</command>
		  are 512, 1232, 1432, and 4096, but never exceed
		  <command>edns-udp-size</command>.  (The values 1232 and

		  This value applies to responses sent by a server; to

		</para>
		<para>
		  The usual reason for setting

	    servers.  The official servers which cover these namespaces
	    return NXDOMAIN responses to these queries.  In particular,
	    these cover the reverse namespaces for addresses from
	    RFC 1918, RFC 4193, RFC 5737, and RFC 6598.  They also include the
	    reverse namespace for the IPv6 local address (locally assigned),
	    IPv6 link local addresses, the IPv6 loopback address, and the
	    IPv6 unknown address.

	<section xml:id="acache"><info><title>Additional Section Caching</title></info>


	  <para>
	    The additional section cache, also called <command>acache</command>,
	    is an internal cache to improve the response performance of BIND 9.
	    When additional section caching is enabled, BIND 9
	    caches an internal shortcut to the additional section content for
	    each answer RR.
	    Note that <command>acache</command> is an internal caching
	    mechanism of BIND 9, and is not related to the DNS caching
	    server function.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Additional section caching does not change the
	    response content (except the RRsets ordering of the additional
	    section; see below), but can improve the response performance
	    significantly.
	    It is particularly effective when BIND 9 acts as an authoritative
	    server for a zone that has many delegations with many glue RRs.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    To obtain the maximum performance improvement
	    from additional section caching, setting
	    <command>additional-from-cache</command>
	    to <command>no</command> is recommended, since the current
	    implementation of <command>acache</command>
	    does not shortcut additional section information from the
	    DNS cache data.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    One obvious disadvantage of <command>acache</command> is
	    that it requires much more
	    memory for the internal cached data.
	    Thus, if the response performance does not matter and memory
	    consumption is more critical, the
	    <command>acache</command> mechanism can be
	    disabled by setting <command>acache-enable</command> to
	    <command>no</command>.
	    It is also possible to specify the upper limit of memory
	    consumption
	    for <command>acache</command> by using <command>max-acache-size</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Additional section caching also has a minor effect on the
	    RRset ordering in the additional section.
	    Without <command>acache</command>,
	    <command>cyclic</command> order is effective for the additional
	    section as well as for the answer and authority sections.
	    However, additional section caching fixes the ordering when it
	    first caches an RRset for the additional section, and the same
	    ordering is kept in succeeding responses, regardless of the
	    setting of <command>rrset-order</command>.
	    The effect of this should be minor, however, since an
	    RRset in the additional section
	    typically only contains a small number of RRs (and in many cases
	    only a single RR), so the
	    ordering is not significant.

	<section xml:id="content_filtering"><info><title>Content Filtering</title></info>

	  <para>
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 provides the ability to filter
	    out responses from external DNS servers containing
	    certain types of data in the answer section.
	    Specifically, it can reject address (A or AAAA) records if
	    the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 addresses match the given
	    <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
	    <command>deny-answer-addresses</command> option.
	    It can also reject CNAME or DNAME records if the "alias"
	    name (i.e., the CNAME alias or the substituted query name
	    due to DNAME) matches the
	    given <varname>namelist</varname> of the
	    <command>deny-answer-aliases</command> option, where
	    "match" means the alias name is a subdomain of one of
	    the <varname>name_list</varname> elements.
	    If the optional <varname>namelist</varname> is specified
	    with <command>except-from</command>, records whose query name
	    matches the list are accepted regardless of the filter
	    setting.
	    Likewise, if the alias name is a subdomain of the
	    corresponding zone, the <command>deny-answer-aliases</command>
	    filter does not apply;
	    for example, even if "example.com" is specified for
	    <command>deny-answer-aliases</command>,
	  </para>
<programlisting>www.example.com. CNAME xxx.example.com.</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    returned by an "example.com" server is accepted.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    In the <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
	    <command>deny-answer-addresses</command> option, only
	    <varname>ip_addr</varname>
	    and <varname>ip_prefix</varname>
	    are meaningful;
	    any <varname>key_id</varname> is silently ignored.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If a response message is rejected due to the filtering,
	    the entire message is discarded without being cached, and
	    a SERVFAIL error is returned to the client.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    This filtering is intended to prevent "DNS rebinding attacks," in
	    which an attacker, in response to a query for a domain name the
	    attacker controls, returns an IP address within the user's own network or
	    an alias name within the user's own domain.
	    A naive web browser or script could then serve as an
	    unintended proxy, allowing the attacker
	    to get access to an internal node of the local network
	    that could not be externally accessed otherwise.
	    See the paper available at
	    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1315245.1315298">
	    https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1315245.1315298
	    </link>
	    for more details about these attacks.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    For example, with a domain named "example.net" and
	    an internal network using an IPv4 prefix 192.0.2.0/24,
	    an administrator might specify the following rules:
	  </para>

<programlisting>deny-answer-addresses { 192.0.2.0/24; } except-from { "example.net"; };
deny-answer-aliases { "example.net"; };
</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    If an external attacker let a web browser in the local
	    network look up an IPv4 address of "attacker.example.com",
	    the attacker's DNS server would return a response like this:
	  </para>

<programlisting>attacker.example.com. A 192.0.2.1</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    in the answer section.
	    Since the rdata of this record (the IPv4 address) matches
	    the specified prefix 192.0.2.0/24, this response would be
	    ignored.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    On the other hand, if the browser looked up a legitimate
	    internal web server "www.example.net" and the
	    following response were returned to
	    the <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 server:
	  </para>

<programlisting>www.example.net. A 192.0.2.2</programlisting>

	  <para>
	    it would be accepted, since the owner name "www.example.net"
	    matches the <command>except-from</command> element,
	    "example.net".
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note that this is not really an attack on the DNS per se.
	    In fact, there is nothing wrong with having an "external" name
	    mapped to an "internal" IP address or domain name
	    from the DNS point of view;
	    it might actually be provided for a legitimate purpose,
	    such as for debugging.
	    As long as the mapping is provided by the correct owner,
	    it either is not possible or does not make sense to detect
	    whether the intent of the mapping is legitimate
	    within the DNS.
	    The "rebinding" attack must primarily be protected at the
	    application that uses the DNS.
	    For a large site, however, it may be difficult to protect
	    all possible applications at once.
	    This filtering feature is provided only to help such an
	    operational environment;
	    turning it on is generally discouraged unless there is
	    no other choice and the attack is a
	    real threat to applications.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Care should be particularly taken if using this
	    option for addresses within 127.0.0.0/8.
	    These addresses are obviously "internal," but many
	    applications conventionally rely on a DNS mapping from
	    some name to such an address.
	    Filtering out DNS records containing this address
	    spuriously can break such applications.

	<section xml:id="rpz"><info><title>Response Policy Zone (RPZ) Rewriting</title></info>

	  <para>
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 includes a limited
	    mechanism to modify DNS responses for requests
	    analogous to email anti-spam DNS rejection lists.
	    Responses can be changed to deny the existence of domains (NXDOMAIN),
	    deny the existence of IP addresses for domains (NODATA),
	    or contain other IP addresses or data.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Response policy zones are named in the
	    <command>response-policy</command> option for the view or among the
	    global options if there is no <command>response-policy</command> option for the view.
	    Response policy zones are ordinary DNS zones containing RRsets
	    that can be queried normally if allowed.
	    It is usually best to restrict those queries with something like
	    <command>allow-query { localhost; };</command>.
	    Note that zones using <command>masterfile-format map</command>
	    cannot be used as policy zones.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    A <command>response-policy</command> option can support
	    multiple policy zones.  To maximize performance, a radix
	    tree is used to quickly identify response policy zones
	    containing triggers that match the current query.  This

	    The query response is checked against all response policy zones,

	  <para>
	    By default, the actions encoded in a response policy zone
	    are applied only to queries that ask for recursion (RD=1).
	    That default can be changed for a single policy zone, or for
	    all response policy zones in a view,
	    with a <command>recursive-only no</command> clause.
	    This feature is useful for serving the same zone files
	    both inside and outside an RFC 1918 cloud and using RPZ to
	    delete answers that would otherwise contain RFC 1918 values
	    on the externally visible name server or view.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Also by default, RPZ actions are applied only to DNS requests
	    that either do not request DNSSEC metadata (DO=0) or when no
	    DNSSEC records are available for the requested name in the original
	    zone (not the response policy zone).  This default can be
	    changed for all response policy zones in a view with a
	    <command>break-dnssec yes</command> clause.  In that case, RPZ
	    actions are applied regardless of DNSSEC.  The name of the
	    clause option reflects the fact that results rewritten by RPZ
	    actions cannot verify.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    No DNS records are needed for a QNAME or Client-IP trigger;
	    the name or IP address itself is sufficient,
	    so in principle the query name need not be recursively resolved.
	    However, not resolving the requested
	    name can leak the fact that response policy rewriting is in use,
	    and that the name is listed in a policy zone, to operators of
	    servers for listed names.  To prevent that information leak, by
	    default any recursion needed for a request is done before any
	    policy triggers are considered.  Because listed domains often
	    have slow authoritative servers, this behavior can cost
	    significant time.
	    The <command>qname-wait-recurse no</command> option
	    overrides that default behavior when recursion cannot
	    change a non-error response.
	    The option does not affect QNAME or client-IP triggers
	    in policy zones listed
	    after other zones containing IP, NSIP, and NSDNAME triggers, because
	    those may depend on the A, AAAA, and NS records that would be
	    found during recursive resolution.  It also does not affect
	    DNSSEC requests (DO=1) unless <command>break-dnssec yes</command>
	    is in use, because the response would depend on whether
	    RRSIG records were found during resolution.
	    Using this option can cause error responses such as SERVFAIL to
	    appear to be rewritten, since no recursion is being done to
	    discover problems at the authoritative server.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The TTL of a record modified by RPZ policies is set from the
	    TTL of the relevant record in the policy zone.  It is then limited

	    maximum number of seconds from its default of 5.

	    RPZ can affect server performance.

	    For example, a DNS server with four policy zones, each with all

	    NSDNAME), requires a total of 17 times as many database
	    lookups as a similar DNS server with no response policy zones.
	    A <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 server with adequate memory and one
	    response policy zone with QNAME and IP triggers might achieve a
	    maximum queries-per-second (QPS) rate about 20% lower.

	  <para>
	    Excessive, almost identical UDP <emphasis>responses</emphasis>
	    can be controlled by configuring a
	    <command>rate-limit</command> clause in an
	    <command>options</command> or <command>view</command> statement.
	    This mechanism keeps authoritative BIND 9 from being used
	    to amplify reflection denial of service (DoS) attacks.
	    Short, truncated (TC=1) responses can be sent to provide
	    rate-limited responses to legitimate clients within
	    a range of forged, attacked IP addresses.
	    Legitimate clients react to dropped or truncated responses
	    by retrying with UDP or with TCP, respectively.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    This mechanism is intended for authoritative DNS servers.
	    It can be used on recursive servers, but can slow
	    applications such as SMTP servers (mail receivers) and
	    HTTP clients (web browsers) that repeatedly request the
	    same domains.
	    When possible, closing "open" recursive servers is better.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Response rate limiting uses a "credit" or "token bucket" scheme.
	    Each combination of identical response and client
	    has a conceptual "account" that earns a specified number
	    of credits every second.
	    A prospective response debits its account by one.
	    Responses are dropped or truncated
	    while the account is negative.
	    Responses are tracked within a rolling window of time
	    which defaults to 15 seconds, but which can be configured with
	    the <command>window</command> option to any value from
	    1 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
	    The account cannot become more positive than
	    the per-second limit
	    or more negative than <command>window</command>
	    times the per-second limit.
	    When the specified number of credits for a class of
	    responses is set to 0, those responses are not rate-limited.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The notions of "identical response" and "DNS client"
	    for rate limiting are not simplistic.
	    All responses to an address block are counted as if to a
	    single client.
	    The prefix lengths of address blocks are
	    specified with <command>ipv4-prefix-length</command> (default 24)
	    and <command>ipv6-prefix-length</command> (default 56).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    All non-empty responses for a valid domain name (qname)
	    and record type (qtype) are identical and have a limit specified
	    with <command>responses-per-second</command>
	    (default 0 or no limit).
	    All empty (NODATA) responses for a valid domain,
	    regardless of query type, are identical.
	    Responses in the NODATA class are limited by
	    <command>nodata-per-second</command>
	    (default <command>responses-per-second</command>).
	    Requests for any and all undefined subdomains of a given
	    valid domain result in NXDOMAIN errors, and are identical
	    regardless of query type.
	    They are limited by <command>nxdomains-per-second</command>
	    (default <command>responses-per-second</command>).
	    This controls some attacks using random names, but
	    can be relaxed or turned off (set to 0)
	    on servers that expect many legitimate
	    NXDOMAIN responses, such as from anti-spam rejection lists.
	    Referrals or delegations to the server of a given
	    domain are identical and are limited by
	    <command>referrals-per-second</command>
	    (default <command>responses-per-second</command>).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Responses generated from local wildcards are counted and limited

	  <para>
	    All requests that result in DNS errors other
	    than NXDOMAIN, such as SERVFAIL and FORMERR, are identical
	    regardless of requested name (qname) or record type (qtype).
	    This controls attacks using invalid requests or distant,
	    broken authoritative servers.
	    By default the limit on errors is the same as the
	    <command>responses-per-second</command> value,
	    but it can be set separately with
	    <command>errors-per-second</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Many attacks using DNS involve UDP requests with forged source
	    addresses.
	    Rate limiting prevents the use of BIND 9 to flood a network
	    with responses to requests with forged source addresses,
	    but could let a third party block responses to legitimate requests.
	    There is a mechanism that can answer some legitimate
	    requests from a client whose address is being forged in a flood.
	    Setting <command>slip</command> to 2 (its default) causes every
	    other UDP request to be answered with a small truncated (TC=1)
	    response.
	    The small size and reduced frequency, and resulting lack of
	    amplification, of "slipped" responses make them unattractive
	    for reflection DoS attacks.
	    <command>slip</command> must be between 0 and 10.
	    A value of 0 does not "slip";
	    no truncated responses are sent due to rate limiting.
	    Rather, all responses are dropped.
	    A value of 1 causes every response to slip;
	    values between 2 and 10 cause every nth response to slip.
	    Some error responses, including REFUSED and SERVFAIL,
	    cannot be replaced with truncated responses and are instead
	    leaked at the <command>slip</command> rate.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    (Note: dropped responses from an authoritative server may
	    reduce the difficulty of a third party successfully forging
	    a response to a recursive resolver. The best security
	    against forged responses is for authoritative operators
	    to sign their zones using DNSSEC and for resolver operators
	    to validate the responses. When this is not an option,
	    operators who are more concerned with response integrity
	    than with flood mitigation may consider setting
	    <command>slip</command> to 1, causing all rate-limited
	    responses to be truncated rather than dropped.  This reduces
	    the effectiveness of rate-limiting against reflection attacks.)
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When the approximate query-per-second rate exceeds
	    the <command>qps-scale</command> value,
	    the <command>responses-per-second</command>,
	    <command>errors-per-second</command>,
	    <command>nxdomains-per-second</command>, and
	    <command>all-per-second</command> values are reduced by the
	    ratio of the current rate to the <command>qps-scale</command> value.
	    This feature can tighten defenses during attacks.
	    For example, with
	    <command>qps-scale 250; responses-per-second 20;</command> and
	    a total query rate of 1000 queries/second for all queries from
	    all DNS clients including via TCP,
	    then the effective responses/second limit changes to
	    (250/1000)*20, or 5.
	    Responses sent via TCP are not limited
	    but are counted to compute the query-per-second rate.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Communities of DNS clients can be given their own parameters or no
	    rate limiting by putting
	    <command>rate-limit</command> statements in <command>view</command>
	    statements instead of in the global <command>option</command>
	    statement.
	    A <command>rate-limit</command> statement in a view replaces,
	    rather than supplements, a <command>rate-limit</command>
	    statement among the main options.
	    DNS clients within a view can be exempted from rate limits
	    with the <command>exempt-clients</command> clause.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    UDP responses of all kinds can be limited with the
	    <command>all-per-second</command> phrase.  This rate
	    limiting is unlike the rate limiting provided by
	    <command>responses-per-second</command>,
	    <command>errors-per-second</command>, and
	    <command>nxdomains-per-second</command> on a DNS server,
	    which are often invisible to the victim of a DNS
	    reflection attack.  Unless the forged requests of the
	    attack are the same as the legitimate requests of the
	    victim, the victim's requests are not affected.  Responses
	    affected by an <command>all-per-second</command> limit
	    are always dropped; the <command>slip</command> value
	    has no effect.  An <command>all-per-second</command>
	    limit should be at least 4 times as large as the other
	    limits, because single DNS clients often send bursts
	    of legitimate requests.  For example, the receipt of a
	    single mail message can prompt requests from an SMTP
	    server for NS, PTR, A, and AAAA records as the incoming
	    SMTP/TCP/IP connection is considered.  The SMTP server
	    can need additional NS, A, AAAA, MX, TXT, and SPF records
	    as it considers the SMTP <command>Mail From</command>
	    command.  Web browsers often repeatedly resolve the
	    same names that are duplicated in HTML &lt;IMG&gt; tags
	    in a page.  <command>all-per-second</command> is similar
	    to the rate limiting offered by firewalls but is often
	    inferior.  Attacks that justify ignoring the contents
	    of DNS responses are likely to be attacks on the DNS
	    server itself.  They usually should be discarded before
	    the DNS server spends resources make TCP connections
	    or parsing DNS requests, but that rate limiting must
	    be done before the DNS server sees the requests.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The maximum size of the table used to track requests and
	    rate-limit responses is set with <command>max-table-size</command>.
	    Each entry in the table is between 40 and 80 bytes.
	    The table needs approximately as many entries as the number
	    of requests received per second.
	    The default is 20,000.
	    To reduce the cold start of growing the table,
	    <command>min-table-size</command> (default 500)
	    can set the minimum table size.
	    Enable <command>rate-limit</command> category logging to monitor
	    expansions of the table and inform

	      <listitem>Redirect namespace</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    With either method, when <command>named</command> gets an NXDOMAIN response
	    it examines a separate namespace to see if the NXDOMAIN
	    response should be replaced with an alternative response.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    With a redirect zone (<command>zone "." { type redirect; };</command>), the
	    data used to replace the NXDOMAIN is held in a single
	    zone which is not part of the normal namespace.  All the
	    redirect information is contained in the zone; there are
	    no delegations.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    With a redirect namespace (<command>option { nxdomain-redirect
	    &lt;suffix&gt; };</command>), the data used to replace the
	    NXDOMAIN is part of the normal namespace and is looked up by
	    appending the specified suffix to the original query name.
	    This roughly doubles the cache required to process NXDOMAIN

	    the replacement data (or a NXDOMAIN indicating that there
	    is no replacement) must be stored.

	<section xml:id="server_statement_definition_and_usage"><info><title><command>server</command> Statement Definition and
	    Usage</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The <command>server</command> statement defines
	    characteristics
	    to be associated with a remote name server.  If a prefix length is
	    specified, then a range of servers is covered.  Only the most
	    specific
	    server clause applies, regardless of the order in
	    <filename>named.conf</filename>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>server</command> statement can occur at
	    the top level of the
	    configuration file or inside a <command>view</command>
	    statement.
	    If a <command>view</command> statement contains
	    one or more <command>server</command> statements, only
	    those
	    apply to the view and any top-level ones are ignored.
	    If a view contains no <command>server</command>
	    statements,
	    any top-level <command>server</command> statements are
	    used as
	    defaults.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If a remote server is giving out bad data,
	    marking it as bogus prevents further queries to it. The
	    default
	    value of <command>bogus</command> is <command>no</command>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <command>provide-ixfr</command> clause determines
	    whether
	    the local server, acting as primary, responds with an
	    incremental
	    zone transfer when the given remote server, a secondary, requests it.
	    If set to <command>yes</command>, incremental transfer
	    is provided
	    whenever possible. If set to <command>no</command>,
	    all transfers
	    to the remote server are non-incremental. If not set, the
	    value
	    of the <command>provide-ixfr</command> option in the
	    view or
	    global options block is used as a default.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>request-ixfr</command> clause determines
	    whether
	    the local server, acting as a secondary, requests incremental zone
	    transfers from the given remote server, a primary. If not set, the
	    value of the <command>request-ixfr</command> option in
	    the view or global options block is used as a default. It may
	    also be set in the zone block; if set there, it
	    overrides the global or view setting for that zone.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    IXFR requests to servers that do not support IXFR
	    automatically
	    fall back to AXFR.  Therefore, there is no need to manually list
	    which servers support IXFR and which ones do not; the global
	    default
	    of <command>yes</command> should always work.
	    The purpose of the <command>provide-ixfr</command> and
	    <command>request-ixfr</command> clauses is
	    to make it possible to disable the use of IXFR even when both
	    primary
	    and secondary claim to support it: for example, if one of the servers
	    is buggy and crashes or corrupts data when IXFR is used.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>request-expire</command> clause determines
	    whether the local server, when acting as a secondary,
	    requests the EDNS EXPIRE value.  The EDNS EXPIRE value
	    indicates the remaining time before the zone data
	    expires and needs to be refreshed.  This is used
	    when a secondary server transfers a zone from another
	    secondary server; when transferring from the primary, the
	    expiration timer is set from the EXPIRE field of the SOA
	    record instead.
	    The default is <command>yes</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>edns</command> clause determines whether
	    the local server attempts to use EDNS when communicating
	    with the remote server.  The default is <command>yes</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>edns-udp-size</command> option sets the
	    EDNS UDP size that is advertised by <command>named</command>
	    when querying the remote server.  Valid values are 512
	    to 4096 bytes; values outside this range are silently
	    adjusted to the nearest value within it.  This option
	    is useful when advertising a different value
	    to this server than the value advertised globally:
	    for example, when there is a firewall at the remote
	    site that is blocking large replies. Note: currently,
	    this sets a single UDP size for all packets sent to the
	    server; <command>named</command> does not deviate from
	    this value.  This differs from the behavior of
	    <command>edns-udp-size</command> in <command>options</command>
	    or <command>view</command> statements, where it specifies
	    a maximum value. The <command>server</command> statement
	    behavior may be brought into conformance with the
	    <command>options/view</command> behavior in future releases.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>edns-version</command> option sets the
	    maximum EDNS VERSION that is sent to the server(s)
	    by the resolver.  The actual EDNS version sent is still
	    subject to normal EDNS version-negotiation rules (see
	    RFC 6891), the maximum EDNS version supported by the
	    server, and any other heuristics that indicate that a
	    lower version should be sent.  This option is intended
	    to be used when a remote server reacts badly to a given
	    EDNS version or higher; it should be set to the highest
	    version the remote server is known to support.  Valid
	    values are 0 to 255; higher values are silently
	    adjusted.  This option is not needed until higher
	    EDNS versions than 0 are in use.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>max-udp-size</command> option sets the
	    maximum EDNS UDP message size <command>named</command>
	    sends.  Valid values are 512 to 4096 bytes; values
	    outside this range are silently adjusted.  This
	    option is useful when there is a firewall
	    that is blocking large replies from <command>named</command>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>tcp-only</command> option sets the transport
	    protocol to TCP. The default is to use the UDP transport
	    and to fallback on TCP only when a truncated response
	    is received.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The server supports two zone transfer methods. The first, <command>one-answer</command>,
	    uses one DNS message per resource record transferred. <command>many-answers</command> packs
	    as many resource records as possible into a single message, which is
	    more efficient. It is possible to specify which method
	    to use for a server via the <command>transfer-format</command> option;
	    If not set there, the <command>transfer-format</command>
	    specified
	    by the <command>options</command> statement is
	    used.
	  </para>

	  <para><command>transfers</command>
	    is used to limit the number of concurrent inbound zone
	    transfers from the specified server. If no
	    <command>transfers</command> clause is specified, the
	    limit is set according to the
	    <command>transfers-per-ns</command> option.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>keys</command> clause identifies a
	    <command>key_id</command> defined by the <command>key</command> statement,
	    to be used for transaction security (TSIG, <xref linkend="tsig"/>)
	    when talking to the remote server.
	    When a request is sent to the remote server, a request signature
	    is generated using the key specified here and appended to the
	    message. A request originating from the remote server is not
	    required
	    to be signed by this key.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Only a single key per server is currently supported.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>transfer-source</command> and
	    <command>transfer-source-v6</command> clauses specify
	    the IPv4 and IPv6 source
	    address, respectively, to be used for zone transfer with the remote server.
	    For an IPv4 remote server, only <command>transfer-source</command> can
	    be specified.
	    Similarly, for an IPv6 remote server, only
	    <command>transfer-source-v6</command> can be
	    specified.
	    For more details, see the description of
	    <command>transfer-source</command> and

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>notify-source</command> and
	    <command>notify-source-v6</command> clauses specify the
	    IPv4 and IPv6 source address, respectively, to be used for notify
	    messages sent to remote servers.  For an
	    IPv4 remote server, only <command>notify-source</command>
	    can be specified.  Similarly, for an IPv6 remote server,
	    only <command>notify-source-v6</command> can be specified.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>query-source</command> and
	    <command>query-source-v6</command> clauses specify the
	    IPv4 and IPv6 source address, respectively, to be used for queries
	    sent to remote servers.  For an IPv4
	    remote server, only <command>query-source</command> can
	    be specified.  Similarly, for an IPv6 remote server,
	    only <command>query-source-v6</command> can be specified.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>request-nsid</command> clause determines
	    whether the local server adds an NSID EDNS option
	    to requests sent to the server.  This overrides
	    <command>request-nsid</command> set at the view or
	    option level.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>send-cookie</command> clause determines
	    whether the local server adds a COOKIE EDNS option
	    to requests sent to the server.  This overrides
	    <command>send-cookie</command> set at the view or
	    option level.  The <command>named</command> server may
	    determine that COOKIE is not supported by the remote server
	    and not add a COOKIE EDNS option to requests.

	<para>
	  The <command>statistics-channels</command> statement
	  declares communication channels to be used by system
	  administrators to get access to statistics information on
	  the name server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This statement is intended to be flexible to support multiple
	  communication protocols in the future, but currently only
	  HTTP access is supported.
	  It requires that BIND 9 be compiled with libxml2 and/or
	  json-c (also known as libjson0); the
	  <command>statistics-channels</command> statement is
	  still accepted even if it is built without the library,
	  but any HTTP access fails with an error.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An <command>inet</command> control channel is a TCP socket
	  listening at the specified <command>ip_port</command> on the
	  specified <command>ip_addr</command>, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6
	  address.  An <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>*</literal>
	  (asterisk) is
	  interpreted as the IPv4 wildcard address; connections are
	  accepted on any of the system's IPv4 addresses.
	  To listen on the IPv6 wildcard address,
	  use an <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>::</literal>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no port is specified, port 80 is used for HTTP channels.
	  The asterisk (<literal>*</literal>) cannot be used for
	  <command>ip_port</command>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Attempts to open a statistics channel are
	  restricted by the optional <command>allow</command> clause.
	  Connections to the statistics channel are permitted based on the
	  <command>address_match_list</command>.
	  If no <command>allow</command> clause is present,
	  <command>named</command> accepts connection
	  attempts from any address; since the statistics may
	  contain sensitive internal information, it is highly
	  recommended to restrict the source of connection requests
	  appropriately.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If no <command>statistics-channels</command> statement is present,
	  <command>named</command> does not open any communication channels.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The statistics are available in various formats and views,
	  depending on the URI used to access them.  For example, if
	  the statistics channel is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1
	  port 8888, then the statistics are accessible in XML format at
	  <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</link> or

	  included, which can format the XML statistics into tables
	  when viewed with a stylesheet-capable browser, and into
	  charts and graphs using the Google Charts API when using a
	  JavaScript-capable browser.

	  <para>
	    The <command>trusted-keys</command> statement defines
	    DNSSEC security roots. DNSSEC is described in <xref linkend="DNSSEC"/>. A security root is defined when the
	    public key for a non-authoritative zone is known, but
	    cannot be securely obtained through DNS, either because
	    it is the DNS root zone or because its parent zone is
	    unsigned.  Once a key has been configured as a trusted
	    key, it is treated as if it has been validated and
	    proven secure. The resolver attempts DNSSEC validation
	    on all DNS data in subdomains of a security root.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    All keys (and corresponding zones) listed in
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> are deemed to exist regardless
	    of what parent zones say.  Similarly, for all keys listed in
	    <command>trusted-keys</command>, only those keys are
	    used to validate the DNSKEY RRset.  The parent's DS RRset
	    is not used.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <command>trusted-keys</command> statement can contain
	    multiple key entries, each consisting of the key's
	    domain name, flags, protocol, and algorithm, and the Base64
	    representation of the key data.
	    Spaces, tabs, newlines, and carriage returns are ignored
	    in the key data, so the configuration may be split into
	    multiple lines.

	  <para>
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> may be set at the top level

	    and Usage</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The <command>managed-keys</command> statement, like
	    <command>trusted-keys</command>, defines DNSSEC
	    security roots.  The difference is that
	    <command>managed-keys</command> can be kept up-to-date
	    automatically, without intervention from the resolver
	    operator.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Suppose, for example, that a zone's key-signing
	    key was compromised, and the zone owner had to revoke and
	    replace the key.  A resolver which had the old key in a
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> statement would be
	    unable to validate this zone; it would
	    reply with a SERVFAIL response code.  This would
	    continue until the resolver operator updated the
	    <command>trusted-keys</command> statement with the new key.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If, however, the zone were listed in a
	    <command>managed-keys</command> statement instead, the
	    zone owner could add a "stand-by" key to the zone in advance.
	    <command>named</command> would store the stand-by key, and
	    when the original key was revoked, <command>named</command>
	    would be able to transition smoothly to the new key.  It would
	    also recognize that the old key had been revoked and cease
	    using that key to validate answers, minimizing the damage that
	    the compromised key could do.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    A <command>managed-keys</command> statement contains a list of
	    the keys to be managed, along with information about how the
	    keys are to be initialized for the first time.  The only
	    initialization method currently supported is
	    <literal>initial-key</literal>.
	    This means the <command>managed-keys</command> statement must
	    contain a copy of the initializing key.  (Future releases may
	    allow keys to be initialized by other methods, eliminating this
	    requirement.)
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Consequently, a <command>managed-keys</command> statement
	    appears similar to a <command>trusted-keys</command> statement, differing
	    by the presence of the second field, which contains the keyword
	    <literal>initial-key</literal>.  The difference is, whereas the
	    keys listed in a <command>trusted-keys</command> continue to be
	    trusted until they are removed from
	    <filename>named.conf</filename>, an initializing key listed
	    in a <command>managed-keys</command> statement is only trusted
	    <emphasis>once</emphasis>: for as long as it takes to load the
	    managed-key database and start the RFC 5011 key-maintenance
	    process.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The first time <command>named</command> runs with a managed key
	    configured in <filename>named.conf</filename>, it fetches the
	    DNSKEY RRset directly from the zone apex, and validates it
	    using the key specified in the <command>managed-keys</command>
	    statement.  If the DNSKEY RRset is validly signed, then it is
	    used as the basis for a new managed-keys database.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    From that point on, whenever <command>named</command> runs, it
	    sees the <command>managed-keys</command> statement, checks to
	    make sure RFC 5011 key maintenance has already been initialized
	    for the specified domain, and if so, simply moves on.  The
	    key specified in the <command>managed-keys</command>
	    statement is not used to validate answers; it is
	    superseded by the key or keys stored in the managed-keys database.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The next time <command>named</command> runs after a name
	    has been <emphasis>removed</emphasis> from the
	    <command>managed-keys</command> statement, the corresponding
	    zone is removed from the managed-keys database,
	    and RFC 5011 key maintenance is no longer used for that
	    domain.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In the current implementation, the managed-keys database
	    is stored as a master-format zone file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    On servers which do not use views, this file is named
	    <filename>managed-keys.bind</filename>.  When views are in
	    use, there is a separate managed-keys database for each
	    view; the filename is the view name (or, if a view name
	    contains characters which would make it illegal as a filename,
	    a hash of the view name), followed by
	    the suffix <filename>.mkeys</filename>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    When the key database is changed, the zone is updated.
	    As with any other dynamic zone, changes are written
	    into a journal file, e.g.,
	    <filename>managed-keys.bind.jnl</filename> or
	    <filename>internal.mkeys.jnl</filename>.
	    Changes are committed to the zone file as soon as
	    possible afterward, usually within 30
	    seconds.  Whenever <command>named</command> is using
	    automatic key maintenance, the zone file and journal file
	    can be expected to exist in the working directory.
	    (For this reason, among others, the working directory
	    should be always be writable by <command>named</command>.)
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the <command>dnssec-validation</command> option is
	    set to <userinput>auto</userinput>, <command>named</command>
	    automatically initializes a managed key for the
	    root zone.  The key that is used to initialize the
		key-maintenance process is stored in <filename>bind.keys</filename>;
	    the location of this file can be overridden with the
	    <command>bindkeys-file</command> option. As a fallback
	    in the event no <filename>bind.keys</filename> can be
	    found, the initializing key is also compiled directly
	    into <command>named</command>.

	  <para>
	    The <command>view</command> statement is a powerful
	    feature
	    of <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 that lets a name server
	    answer a DNS query differently
	    depending on who is asking. It is particularly useful for
	    implementing
	    split DNS setups without having to run multiple servers.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Each <command>view</command> statement defines a view
	    of the
	    DNS namespace that is seen by a subset of clients.  A client
	    matches
	    a view if its source IP address matches the
	    <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the view's
	    <command>match-clients</command> clause and its
	    destination IP address matches
	    the <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
	    view's
	    <command>match-destinations</command> clause.  If not
	    specified, both
	    <command>match-clients</command> and <command>match-destinations</command>
	    default to matching all addresses.  In addition to checking IP
	    addresses,
	    <command>match-clients</command> and <command>match-destinations</command>
	    can also take <command>keys</command> which provide an
	    mechanism for the
	    client to select the view.  A view can also be specified
	    as <command>match-recursive-only</command>, which
	    means that only recursive
	    requests from matching clients match that view.
	    The order of the <command>view</command> statements is
	    significant;
	    a client request is resolved in the context of the first
	    <command>view</command> that it matches.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Zones defined within a <command>view</command>
	    statement are
	    only accessible to clients that match the <command>view</command>.
	    By defining a zone of the same name in multiple views, different
	    zone data can be given to different clients: for example,
	    "internal"
	    and "external" clients in a split DNS setup.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Many of the options given in the <command>options</command> statement
	    can also be used within a <command>view</command>
	    statement, and then
	    apply only when resolving queries with that view.  When no
	    view-specific
	    value is given, the value in the <command>options</command> statement
	    is used as a default.  Also, zone options can have default values
	    specified
	    in the <command>view</command> statement; these
	    view-specific defaults
	    take precedence over those in the <command>options</command> statement.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Views are class-specific.  If no class is given, class IN
	    is assumed.  Note that all non-IN views must contain a hint zone,
	    since only the IN class has compiled-in default hints.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    If there are no <command>view</command> statements in
	    the config
	    file, a default view that matches any client is automatically
	    created
	    in class IN. Any <command>zone</command> statements
	    specified on
	    the top level of the configuration file are considered to be part
	    of
	    this default view, and the <command>options</command>
	    statement
	    applies to the default view. If any explicit <command>view</command>
	    statements are present, all <command>zone</command>
	    statements must
	    occur inside <command>view</command> statements.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Here is an example of a typical split DNS setup implemented
	    using <command>view</command> statements:
	  </para>

<programlisting>view "internal" {
      // This should match our internal networks.
      match-clients { 10.0.0.0/8; };

      // Provide recursive service to internal
      // clients only.
      recursion yes;

      // Provide a complete view of the example.com
      // zone including addresses of internal hosts.
      zone "example.com" {
	    type master;
	    file "example-internal.db";
      };
};

view "external" {
      // Match all clients not matched by the
      // previous view.
      match-clients { any; };

      // Refuse recursive service to external clients.
      recursion no;

      // Provide a restricted view of the example.com
      // zone containing only publicly accessible hosts.
      zone "example.com" {
	   type master;
	   file "example-external.db";
      };
};

		    initiates recursive resolution and sends
		    queries to 192.0.2.1 and/or 2001:db8::1234.

		  <para>
		    This option is only meaningful for static-stub zones.
		    This is a list of domain names of name servers that
		    act as authoritative servers of the static-stub
		    zone.
		    These names are resolved to IP addresses when
		    <command>named</command> needs to send queries to
		    these servers.
		    For this supplemental resolution to be successful,
		    these names must not be a subdomain of the origin
		    name of the static-stub zone.
		    That is, when "example.net" is the origin of a
		    static-stub zone, "ns.example" and
		    "master.example.com" can be specified in the
		    <command>server-names</command> option, but
		    "ns.example.net" cannot; it is rejected by
		    the configuration parser.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		    A non-empty list for this option internally
		    configures the apex NS RR with the specified names.
		    For example, if "example.com" is configured as a
		    static-stub zone with "ns1.example.net" and
		    "ns2.example.net"
		    in a <command>server-names</command> option,
		    the following RRs are internally configured:
		  </para>

<programlisting>example.com. NS ns1.example.net.
example.com. NS ns2.example.net.
</programlisting>

		  <para>
		    These records are used internally to resolve
		    names under the static-stub zone.
		    For instance, if the server receives a query for
		    "www.example.com" with the RD bit on, the server
		    initiates recursive resolution,
		    resolves "ns1.example.net" and/or
		    "ns2.example.net" to IP addresses, and then sends
		    queries to one or more of these addresses.

	  <section xml:id="dynamic_update_policies"><info><title>Dynamic Update Policies</title></info>

	    <para><acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 supports two
	      methods of granting clients the right to perform
	      dynamic updates to a zone, configured by the
	      <command>allow-update</command> and
	      <command>update-policy</command> options.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>allow-update</command> clause is a simple
	      access control list.  Any client that matches
	      the ACL is granted permission to update any record
	      in the zone.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>update-policy</command> clause
	      allows more fine-grained control over which updates are
	      allowed.  It specifies a set of rules, in which each rule
	      either grants or denies permission for one or more
	      names in the zone to be updated by one or more
	      identities. Identity is determined by the key that
	      signed the update request, using either TSIG or SIG(0).
	      In most cases, <command>update-policy</command> rules
	      only apply to key-based identities.  There is no way
	      to specify update permissions based on client source
	      address.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      <command>update-policy</command> rules are only meaningful
	      for primary zones (type <command>master</command>), and are
	      not allowed in any other zone type.
	      It is a configuration error to specify both
	      <command>allow-update</command> and
	      <command>update-policy</command> at the same time.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      A pre-defined <command>update-policy</command> rule can be
	      switched on with the command
	      <command>update-policy local;</command>.
	      <command>named</command> automatically generates a TSIG session
	      key when starting and stores it in a file; this key can then
	      be used by local clients to update the zone while
	      <command>named</command> is running.
	      By default, the session key is stored in the file
	      <filename>/var/run/named/session.key</filename>, the key name
	      is "local-ddns", and the key algorithm is HMAC-SHA256.
	      These values are configurable with the
	      <command>session-keyfile</command>,
	      <command>session-keyname</command>, and
	      <command>session-keyalg</command> options, respectively.
	      A client running on the local system, if run with appropriate
	      permissions, may read the session key from the key file and
	      use it to sign update requests.  The zone's update
	      policy is set to allow that key to change any record
	      within the zone.  Assuming the key name is "local-ddns",
	      this policy is equivalent to:
	    </para>

	    <programlisting>update-policy { grant local-ddns zonesub any; };
	    </programlisting>

	    <para>
	      with the additional restriction that only clients
	      connecting from the local system are permitted to send
	      updates.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that only one session key is generated by
	      <command>named</command>; all zones configured to use
	      <command>update-policy local</command> accept the same key.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The command <command>nsupdate -l</command> implements this
	      feature, sending requests to localhost and signing them using
	      the key retrieved from the session key file.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Other rule definitions look like this:
	    </para>

<programlisting>
( <command>grant</command> | <command>deny</command> ) <replaceable>identity</replaceable> <replaceable>ruletype</replaceable> <optional> <replaceable>name</replaceable> </optional> <optional> <replaceable>types</replaceable> </optional>
</programlisting>

	    <para>
	      Each rule grants or denies privileges.  Rules are checked
	      in the order in which they are specified in the
	      <command>update-policy</command> statement. Once a message
	      has successfully matched a rule, the operation is immediately
	      granted or denied, and no further rules are examined.  There
	      are 13 types of rules; the rule type is specified by the
	      <command>ruletype</command> field, and the interpretation
	      of other fields varies depending on the rule type.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      In general, a rule is matched when the
	      key that signed an update request matches the
	      <command>identity</command> field, the name of the record
	      to be updated matches the <command>name</command> field
	      (in the manner specified by the <command>ruletype</command>
	      field), and the type of the record to be updated matches the
	      <command>types</command> field. Details for each rule type
	      are described below.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>identity</command> field must be set to
	      a fully qualified domain name.  In most cases, this
	      represents the name of the TSIG or SIG(0) key that must be
	      used to sign the update request.  If the specified name is a
	      wildcard, it is subject to DNS wildcard expansion, and the
	      rule may apply to multiple identities.  When a TKEY exchange
	      has been used to create a shared secret, the identity of
	      the key used to authenticate the TKEY exchange is
	      used as the identity of the shared secret.  Some rule types
	      use identities matching the client's Kerberos principal
	      (e.g, <userinput>"host/machine@REALM"</userinput>) or
	      Windows realm (<userinput>machine$@REALM</userinput>).
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <replaceable>name</replaceable> field also specifies
	      a fully qualified domain name. This often
	      represents the name of the record to be updated.
	      Interpretation of this field is dependent on rule type.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      If no <command>types</command> are explicitly specified,
	      then a rule matches all types except RRSIG, NS, SOA, NSEC,
	      and NSEC3. Types may be specified by name, including
	      "ANY"; ANY matches all types except NSEC and NSEC3,
	      which can never be updated.  Note that when an attempt
	      is made to delete all records associated with a name,
	      the rules are checked for each existing record type.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <replaceable>ruletype</replaceable> field has 16
	      values:
	      <varname>name</varname>, <varname>subdomain</varname>,
	      <varname>zonesub</varname>, <varname>wildcard</varname>,

	  <section xml:id="multiple_views"><info><title>Multiple Views</title></info>

	    <para>
	      When multiple views are in use, a zone may be
	      referenced by more than one of them. Often, the views
	      contain different zones with the same name, allowing
	      different clients to receive different answers for the same
	      queries. At times, however, it is desirable for multiple
	      views to contain identical zones.  The
	      <command>in-view</command> zone option provides an efficient
	      way to do this; it allows a view to reference a zone that
	      was defined in a previously configured view. Example:
	    </para>
	    <programlisting>
view internal {
    match-clients { 10/8; };

    zone example.com {
	type master;
	file "example-external.db";
    };
};

view external {
    match-clients { any; };

    zone example.com {
	in-view internal;
    };
};
	    </programlisting>
	    <para>
	      An <command>in-view</command> option cannot refer to a view
	      that is configured later in the configuration file.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      A <command>zone</command> statement which uses the
	      <command>in-view</command> option may not use any other
	      , with the exception of <command>forward</command>
	      and <command>forwarders</command>. (These options control
	      the behavior of the containing view, rather than change
	      the zone object itself.)
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Zone-level ACLs (e.g., allow-query, allow-transfer), and
	      other configuration details of the zone, are all set
	      in the view the referenced zone is defined in.  Be
	      careful to ensure that ACLs are wide enough
	      for all views referencing the zone.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      An <command>in-view</command> zone cannot be used as a

	  <para>
	    This section, largely borrowed from RFC 1034, describes the
	    concept of a Resource Record (RR) and explains when each type is used.
	    Since the publication of RFC 1034, several new RRs have been
	    identified
	    and implemented in the DNS. These are also included.
	  </para>
	  <section><info><title>Resource Records</title></info>

	    <para>
	      A domain name identifies a node.  Each node has a set of
	      resource information, which may be empty.  The set of resource
	      information associated with a particular name is composed of
	      separate RRs. The order of RRs in a set is not significant and
	      need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other
	      parts of the DNS. However, sorting of multiple RRs is
	      permitted for optimization purposes: for example, to specify
	      that a particular nearby server be tried first. See <xref linkend="the_sortlist_statement"/> and <xref linkend="rrset_ordering"/>.

	    <para>
	      The owner name is often implicit, rather than forming an
	      integral
	      part of the RR.  For example, many name servers internally form
	      tree
	      or hash structures for the name space, and chain RRs off nodes.
	      The remaining RR parts are the fixed header (type, class, TTL),
	      which is consistent for all RRs, and a variable part (RDATA)
	      that
	      fits the needs of the resource being described.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The TTL field is a time limit on how long an
	      RR can be kept in a cache.  This limit does not apply to
	      authoritative
	      data in zones; that also times out, but follows the refreshing
	      policies
	      for the zone.  The TTL is assigned by the administrator for the
	      zone where the data originates.  While short TTLs can be used to
	      minimize caching, and a zero TTL prohibits caching, the
	      realities
	      of Internet performance suggest that these times should be on
	      the
	      order of days for the typical host.  If a change can be
	      anticipated,
	      the TTL can be reduced prior to the change to minimize
	      inconsistency, and then increased back to its former value
	      following
	      the change.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The data in the RDATA section of RRs is carried as a combination
	      of binary strings and domain names.  The domain names are
	      frequently
	      used as "pointers" to other data in the DNS.

	    <para>
	      RRs are represented in binary form in the packets of the DNS
	      protocol, and are usually represented in highly encoded form
	      when
	      stored in a name server or resolver.  In the examples provided
	      in
	      RFC 1034, a style similar to that used in zone files was
	      employed
	      in order to show the contents of RRs.  In this format, most RRs
	      are shown on a single line, although continuation lines are
	      possible
	      using parentheses.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The start of the line gives the owner of the RR.  If a line
	      begins with a blank, then the owner is assumed to be the same as
	      that of the previous RR.  Blank lines are often included for
	      readability.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Following the owner are list the TTL, type, and class of the
	      RR.  Class and type use the mnemonics defined above, and TTL is
	      an integer before the type field.  To avoid ambiguity
	      in
	      parsing, type and class mnemonics are disjoint, TTLs are
	      integers,
	      and the type mnemonic is always last. The IN class and TTL
	      values
	      are often omitted from examples in the interest of clarity.

	  <para>
	    As described above, domain servers store information as a
	    series of resource records, each of which contains a particular
	    piece of information about a given domain name (which is usually,
	    but not always, a host). The simplest way to think of a RR is as
	    a typed pair of data, a domain name matched with a relevant datum
	    and stored with some additional type information, to help systems
	    determine when the RR is relevant.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    MX records are used to control delivery of email. The data
	    specified in the record is a priority and a domain name. The
	    priority
	    controls the order in which email delivery is attempted, with the
	    lowest number first. If two priorities are the same, a server is
	    chosen randomly. If no servers at a given priority are responding,
	    the mail transport agent falls back to the next largest
	    priority.
	    Priority numbers do not have any absolute meaning; they are
	    relevant
	    only respective to other MX records for that domain name. The
	    domain
	    name given is the machine to which the mail is delivered.
	    It <emphasis>must</emphasis> have an associated address record
	    (A or AAAA); CNAME is not sufficient.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For a given domain, if there is both a CNAME record and an
	    MX record, the MX record is in error, and is ignored.
	    Instead,
	    the mail is delivered to the server specified in the MX
	    record
	    pointed to by the CNAME.
	    For example:

	    Reverse name resolution (that is, translation from IP address

	    and PTR records. Entries in the in-addr.arpa domain are made in

	    The <command>$GENERATE</command> directive is a <acronym>BIND</acronym> extension

	  <para>
	    In addition to the standard text format, BIND 9
	    supports the ability to read or dump to zone files in
	    other formats.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <constant>raw</constant> format is
	    a binary representation of zone data in a manner similar
	    to that used in zone transfers.  Since it does not require
	    parsing text, load time is significantly reduced.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    An even faster alternative is the <constant>map</constant>
	    format, which is an image of a <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9
	    in-memory zone database; it can be loaded
	    directly into memory via the <command>mmap()</command>
	    function and the zone can begin serving queries almost
	    immediately.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For a primary server, a zone file in
	    <constant>raw</constant> or <constant>map</constant>
	    format is expected to be generated from a textual zone
	    file by the <command>named-compilezone</command> command.
	    For a secondary server or for a dynamic zone, the zone file is automatically
	    generated when
	    <command>named</command> dumps the zone contents after
	    zone transfer or when applying prior updates, if one of these formats is specified by the
	    <command>masterfile-format</command> option.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If a zone file in a binary format needs manual modification,
	    it first must be converted to a textual form by the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command.  Make any
	    necessary modifications to the text file, and
	    then convert it to the binary form via the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command again.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that <command>map</command> format is extremely
	    architecture-specific.  A <constant>map</constant>
	    file <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be used on a system
	    with different pointer size, endianness, or data alignment
	    than the system on which it was generated, and should in
	    general be used only inside a single system.
	    While <constant>raw</constant> format uses
	    network byte order and avoids architecture-dependent
	    data alignment so that it is as portable as
	    possible, it is also primarily expected to be used
	    inside the same single system.  To export a
	    zone file in either <constant>raw</constant> or
	    <constant>map</constant> format, or make a
	    portable backup of such a file, conversion to
	    <constant>text</constant> format is recommended.

	<para>
	  A subset of Name Server Statistics is collected and shown
	  per zone for which the server has the authority, when
	  <command>zone-statistics</command> is set to
	  <userinput>full</userinput> (or <userinput>yes</userinput>),
	  for backward compatibility. See the description of
	  <command>zone-statistics</command> in <xref linkend="options"/>
	  for further details.
	</para>

	<para>
	  These statistics counters are shown with their zone and
	  view names. The view name is omitted when the server is
	  not configured with explicit views.</para>

	<para>
	  There are currently two user interfaces to get access to the
	  statistics.
	  One is in plain-text format, dumped to the file specified
	  by the <command>statistics-file</command> configuration option;
	  the other is remotely accessible via a statistics channel
	  when the <command>statistics-channels</command> statement
	  is specified in the configuration file
	  (see <xref linkend="statschannels"/>.)
	</para>

	<section xml:id="statsfile"><info><title>The Statistics File</title></info>

	  <para>
	    The text format statistics dump begins with a line, like:
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <command>+++ Statistics Dump +++ (973798949)</command>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The number in parentheses is a standard
	    Unix-style timestamp, measured in seconds since January 1, 1970.

	    Following
	    that line is a set of statistics information, which is categorized
	    as described above.
	    Each section begins with a line, like:
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    <command>++ Name Server Statistics ++</command>
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Each section consists of lines, each containing the statistics
	    counter value followed by its textual description;
	    see below for available counters.
	    For brevity, counters that have a value of 0 are not shown
	    in the statistics file.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The statistics dump ends with the line where the
	    number is identical to the number in the beginning line; for example:

	  <para>
	    The following tables summarize the statistics counters that
	    <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 provides.
	    For each row of the tables, the leftmost column is the
	    abbreviated symbol name of that counter;
	    these symbols are shown in the statistics information
	    accessed via an HTTP statistics channel.
	    The rightmost column gives the description of the counter,
	    which is also shown in the statistics file,
	    but, in this document, may be slightly modified
	    for better readability.
	    Additional notes may also be provided in this column.
	    When a middle column exists between these two columns,

      <section xml:id="Access_Control_Lists"><info><title>Access Control Lists</title></info>

	<para>
	  Access Control Lists (ACLs) are address match lists that
	  can be set up and nicknamed for future use in
	  <command>allow-notify</command>, <command>allow-query</command>,
	  <command>allow-query-on</command>, <command>allow-recursion</command>,
	  <command>blackhole</command>, <command>allow-transfer</command>,
	  <command>match-clients</command>, etc.
	</para>
	<para>
	  ACLs give users finer control over who can access
	  the name server, without cluttering up configuration files with huge
	  lists of IP addresses.
	</para>
	<para>
	  It is a <emphasis>good idea</emphasis> to use ACLs, and to
	  control access. Limiting access to the server by
	  outside parties can help prevent spoofing and denial of service
	  (DoS) attacks against the server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  ACLs match clients on the basis of up to three characteristics:
	  1) The client's IP address; 2) the TSIG or SIG(0) key that was
	  used to sign the request, if any; and 3) an address prefix
	  encoded in an EDNS Client-Subnet option, if any.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Here is an example of ACLs based on client addresses:
	</para>

<programlisting>
// Set up an ACL named "bogusnets" that blocks
// RFC 1918 space and some reserved space, which is
// commonly used in spoofing attacks.
acl bogusnets {
	0.0.0.0/8;  192.0.2.0/24; 224.0.0.0/3;
	10.0.0.0/8; 172.16.0.0/12; 192.168.0.0/16;
};

// Set up an ACL called our-nets. Replace this with the
// real IP numbers.
acl our-nets { x.x.x.x/24; x.x.x.x/21; };
options {
  ...
  ...
  allow-query { our-nets; };
  allow-recursion { our-nets; };
  ...
  blackhole { bogusnets; };
  ...
};

zone "example.com" {
  type master;
  file "m/example.com";
  allow-query { any; };
};
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  This allows authoritative queries for "example.com" from any
	  address, but recursive queries only from the networks specified
	  in "our-nets", and no queries at all from the networks
	  specified in "bogusnets".
	</para>
	<para>
	  In addition to network addresses and prefixes, which are
	  matched against the source address of the DNS request, ACLs
	  may include <option>key</option> elements, which specify the
	  name of a TSIG or SIG(0) key, or <option>ecs</option>
	  elements, which specify a network prefix but are only matched
	  if that prefix matches an EDNS client-subnet option included
	  in the request.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The EDNS Client-Subnet (ECS) option is used by a recursive
	  resolver to inform an authoritative name server of the network
	  address block from which the original query was received, enabling
	  authoritative servers to give different answers to the same
	  resolver for different resolver clients.  An ACL containing
	  an element of the form
	  <command>ecs <replaceable>prefix</replaceable></command>
	  will match if a request arrives in containing an ECS option
	  encoding an address within that prefix.  If the request has no
	  ECS option, then "ecs" elements are simply ignored.  Addresses
	  in ACLs that are not prefixed with "ecs" are matched only
	  against the source address.
	</para>
	<note>
	  <simpara>
	    (Note: the authoritative ECS implementation in
	    <command>named</command> is based on an early version of the
	    specification, and is known to have incompatibilities with
	    other implementations.  It is also inefficient, requiring
	    a separate view for each client subnet to be sent different
	    answers, and it is unable to correct for overlapping subnets in
	    the configuration.  It can be used for testing purposes, but is
	    not recommended for production use.)
	  </simpara>
	</note>
	<para>
	  When <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 is built with GeoIP support,
	  ACLs can also be used for geographic access restrictions.
	  This is done by specifying an ACL element of the form:
	  <command>geoip <optional>db <replaceable>database</replaceable></optional> <replaceable>field</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></command>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <replaceable>field</replaceable> parameter indicates which field
	  to search for a match.  Available fields are "country",
	  "region", "city", "continent", "postal" (postal code),
	  "metro" (metro code), "area" (area code), "tz" (timezone),
	  "isp", "asnum", and "domain".
	</para>
	<para>
	  <replaceable>value</replaceable> is the value to search
	  for within the database.  A string may be quoted if it
	  contains spaces or other special characters.  An "asnum"
	  search for autonomous system number can be specified using
	  the string "ASNNNN" or the integer NNNN.
	  When "country" search is specified with a string that is two
	  characters long, it must be a standard ISO-3166-1
	  two-letter country code; otherwise, it is interpreted as
	  the full name of the country.  Similarly, if
	  "region" is the search term and the string is two characters long,
	  it is treated as a standard two-letter state or province
	  abbreviation; otherwise, it is treated as the full name of the
	  state or province.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <replaceable>database</replaceable> field indicates which
	  GeoIP database to search for a match.  In most cases this is
	  unnecessary, because most search fields can only be found in
	  a single database.  However, searches for "continent" or "country"
	  can be answered from either the "city" or "country" databases,
	  so for these search types, specifying a
	  <replaceable>database</replaceable>
	  forces the query to be answered from that database and no
	  other.  If <replaceable>database</replaceable> is not
	  specified, these queries are first answered from the "city"
	  database if it is installed, and then from the "country" database if it
	  is installed. Valid database names are
	  "country", "city", "asnum", "isp", and "domain". (If using
	  the legacy GeoIP API, "netspeed" and "org" databases are also
	  available.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  By default, if a DNS query includes an EDNS Client-Subnet (ECS)
	  option which encodes a non-zero address prefix, then GeoIP ACL
	  elements are matched against that address prefix.  Otherwise,
	  they are matched against the source address of the query.  To
	  prevent GeoIP ACLs from matching against ECS options, set
	  the <command>geoip-use-ecs</command> to <literal>no</literal>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Some example GeoIP ACLs:
	</para>
	<programlisting>geoip country US;
geoip country JP;
geoip db country country Canada;
geoip region WA;
geoip city "San Francisco";
geoip region Oklahoma;
geoip postal 95062;
geoip tz "America/Los_Angeles";
geoip org "Internet Systems Consortium";
</programlisting>

	<para>
	  ACLs use a "first-match" logic rather than "best-match";
	  if an address prefix matches an ACL element, then that ACL
	  is considered to have matched even if a later element would
	  have matched more specifically.  For example, the ACL
	  <command>{ 10/8; !10.0.0.1; }</command> would actually
	  match a query from 10.0.0.1, because the first element
	  indicates that the query should be accepted, and the second
	  element is ignored.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When using "nested" ACLs (that is, ACLs included or referenced
	  within other ACLs), a negative match of a nested ACL tells
	  the containing ACL to continue looking for matches.  This
	  enables complex ACLs to be constructed, in which multiple
	  client characteristics can be checked at the same time. For
	  example, to construct an ACL which allows a query only when
	  it originates from a particular network <emphasis>and</emphasis>
	  only when it is signed with a particular key, use:
	</para>
	<programlisting>
allow-query { !{ !10/8; any; }; key example; };
</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Within the nested ACL, any address that is
	  <emphasis>not</emphasis> in the 10/8 network prefix is
	  rejected, which terminates processing of the
	  ACL.  Any address that <emphasis>is</emphasis> in the 10/8
	  network prefix is accepted, but this causes a negative
	  match of the nested ACL, so the containing ACL continues
	  processing. The query is accepted if it is signed
	  by the key "example", and rejected otherwise.  The ACL, then,
	  only matches when <emphasis>both</emphasis> conditions
	  are true.
	</para>

	  update facility should be strictly limited.  In earlier versions of
	  <acronym>BIND</acronym>, the only way to do this was
	  based on the IP
	  address of the host requesting the update, by listing an IP address
	  or
	  network prefix in the <command>allow-update</command>
	  zone option.
	  This method is insecure, since the source address of the update UDP
	  packet
	  is easily forged.  Also note that if the IP addresses allowed by the
	  <command>allow-update</command> option include the
	  address of a secondary
	  server which performs forwarding of dynamic updates, the primary can
	  be
	  trivially attacked by sending the update to the secondary, which
	  forwards it to the primary with its own source IP address - causing the
	  primary to approve it without question.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For these reasons, we strongly recommend that updates be
	  cryptographically authenticated by means of transaction signatures
	  (TSIG).  That is, the <command>allow-update</command>
	  option should
	  list only TSIG key names, not IP addresses or network
	  prefixes. Alternatively, the <command>update-policy</command>
	  option can be used.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Some sites choose to keep all dynamically updated DNS data
	  in a subdomain and delegate that subdomain to a separate zone. This
	  way, the top-level zone containing critical data, such as the IP
	  addresses
	  of public web and mail servers, need not allow dynamic update at
	  all.

	    The best solution to installation and
	    configuration issues is to take preventive measures by setting
	    up logging files beforehand. The log files provide a
	    source of hints and information that can be used to identify
	    what went wrong and fix the problem.

      <section><info><title>Incrementing and Changing the Serial Number</title></info>

	<para>
	  Zone serial numbers are just numbers — they are not
	  date-related.  However, many people set them to a number that
	  represents a date, usually of the form YYYYMMDDRR.
	  Occasionally they make a mistake and set the serial number to a
	  date in the future, then try to correct it by setting
	  it to the current date.  This causes problems because
	  serial numbers are used to indicate that a zone has been
	  updated.  If the serial number on the secondary server is
	  lower than the serial number on the primary, the secondary
	  server attempts to update its copy of the zone.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Setting the serial number to a lower number on the primary
	  server than the one on the secondary server means that the secondary will not perform
	  updates to its copy of the zone.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The solution to this is to add 2147483647 (2^31-1) to the
	  number, reload the zone and make sure all secondaries have updated to
	  the new zone serial number, then reset it to the desired number
	  and reload the zone again.

      <para xml:id="historical_dns_information">
	Although the Domain Name
	System "officially" began in 1984 with the publication of RFC 920, the
	core of the new system was described in 1983 in RFCs 882 and
	883. From 1984 to 1987, the ARPAnet (the precursor to today's
	Internet) became a testbed of experimentation for developing the
	new naming/addressing scheme in a rapidly expanding,
	operational network environment.  New RFCs were written and
	published in 1987 that modified the original documents to
	incorporate improvements based on the working model. RFC 1034,
	"Domain Names-Concepts and Facilities," and RFC 1035, "Domain
	Names-Implementation and Specification," were published and
	became the standards upon which all <acronym>DNS</acronym> implementations are
	built.
      </para>

      <para>
	The first working domain name server, called "Jeeves," was
	written in 1983-84 by Paul Mockapetris for operation on DEC
	Tops-20
	machines located at the University of Southern California's
	Information
	Sciences Institute (USC-ISI) and SRI International's Network
	Information
	Center (SRI-NIC). A <acronym>DNS</acronym> server for
	Unix machines, the Berkeley Internet
	Name Domain (<acronym>BIND</acronym>) package, was
	written soon after by a group of
	graduate students at the University of California at Berkeley
	under

	project team. After that, additional work on the software package
	was done by Ralph Campbell. Kevin Dunlap, a Digital Equipment
	Corporation
	employee on loan to the CSRG, worked on <acronym>BIND</acronym> for 2 years, from 1985
	to 1987. Many other people also contributed to <acronym>BIND</acronym> development

    <appendix xml:id="Bv9ARM.ch11"><info><title>General <acronym>DNS</acronym> Reference Information</title></info>

      <section xml:id="ipv6addresses"><info><title>IPv6 addresses (AAAA)</title></info>

	  <para>
	    IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers, for interfaces and
	    sets of interfaces, which were introduced in the <acronym>DNS</acronym> to facilitate
	    scalable Internet routing. There are three types of addresses: <emphasis>Unicast</emphasis>,
	    an identifier for a single interface;
	    <emphasis>Anycast</emphasis>,
	    an identifier for a set of interfaces; and <emphasis>Multicast</emphasis>,
	    an identifier for a set of interfaces. Here we describe the global
	    Unicast address scheme. For more information, see RFC 3587,
	    "IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format."
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a
	    <emphasis>global routing prefix</emphasis>, a
	    <emphasis>subnet identifier</emphasis>, and an
	    <emphasis>interface identifier</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The global routing prefix is provided by the
	    upstream provider or ISP, and roughly corresponds to the
	    IPv4 <emphasis>network</emphasis> section
	    of the address range.

	    The subnet identifier is for local subnetting, much
	    like subnetting an
	    IPv4 /16 network into /24 subnets.

	    The interface identifier is the address of an individual
	    interface on a given network; in IPv6, addresses belong to
	    interfaces rather than to machines.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The subnetting capability of IPv6 is much more flexible than
	    that of IPv4; subnetting can be carried out on bit boundaries,
	    in much the same way as Classless InterDomain Routing
	    (CIDR), and the DNS PTR representation ("nibble" format)
	    makes setting up reverse zones easier.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The interface identifier must be unique on the local link,
	    and is usually generated automatically by the IPv6
	    implementation, although it is usually possible to
	    override the default setting if necessary.  A typical IPv6
	    address might look like:
	    <command>2001:db8:201:9:a00:20ff:fe81:2b32</command>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    IPv6 address specifications often contain long strings
	    of zeros, so the architects have included a shorthand for
	    specifying
	    them. The double colon ("::") indicates the longest possible
	    string
	    of zeros that can fit, and can be used only once in an address.

	  <para>
	    Internet Drafts (IDs) are rough-draft working documents of
	    the Internet Engineering Task Force. They are, in essence, RFCs
	    in the preliminary stages of development. Implementors are
	    cautioned not
	    to regard IDs as archival, and they should not be quoted or cited
	    in any formal documents unless accompanied by the disclaimer that
	    they are "works in progress." IDs have a lifespan of six months
	    after which they are deleted unless updated by their authors.
