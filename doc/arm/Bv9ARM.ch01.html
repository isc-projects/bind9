></A
></H1
><P
>The purpose of this document is to explain the installation
and basic upkeep of the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</SPAN
> software package, and we begin by reviewing
the fundamentals of the domain naming system as they relate to <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</SPAN
>.
<SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</SPAN
> consists of a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>nameserver</I
></SPAN
> (or "daemon")
called <B
CLASS="command"
>named</B
> and a <B
CLASS="command"
>resolver</B
> library.
The <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</SPAN
> server runs in the background, servicing queries on a well
known network port. The standard port for the User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), usually port 53,
is specified in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/services</TT
>.
The <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>resolver</I
></SPAN
> is a set of routines residing
in a system library that provides the interface that programs can
use to access the domain name services.</P

CLASS="sect2"

CLASS="sect2"

NAME="AEN135"
>1.4.1. Nameservers</A
></H2
><P
>A nameserver (NS) is a program that stores information about
named resources and responds to queries from programs called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>resolvers</I
></SPAN
> which
act as client processes. The basic function of an NS is to provide
information about network objects by answering queries.</P
><P
>With the nameserver, the network can be broken into a hierarchy
of domains. The name space is organized as a tree according to organizational
or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree, called a domain,
is given a label. The name of the domain is the concatenation of
all the labels of the domains from the root to the current domain.
This is represented in written form as a string of labels listed
from right to left and separated by dots. A label need only be unique
within its domain. The whole name space is partitioned into areas
called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>zones</I
></SPAN
>, each starting at a domain and
extending down to the leaf domains or to domains where other zones
start. Zones usually represent administrative boundaries. For example,
a domain name for a host at the company <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Example, Inc.</I
></SPAN
> would
be:</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>ourhost.example.com</SPAN
></P
><P
>where <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>com</SPAN
> is the top level domain to which
<SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>ourhost.example.com</SPAN
> belongs, 
<SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>example</SPAN
> is
a subdomain of <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>com</SPAN
>, and
<SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>ourhost</SPAN
> is the
name of the host.</P
><P
>The specifications for the domain nameserver are defined in
the RFC 1034, RFC 1035 and RFC 974. These documents can be found
in
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/src/etc/named/doc</TT

>1.4.2. Types of Zones</A
></H2
><P
>As we stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in
the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> tree. A zone consists of those contiguous parts of the domain
tree for which a domain server has complete information and over which
it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point
downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to
other zones. A delegation point has one or more NS records in the
parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at
the root of the delegated zone.</P
><P
>To properly operate a nameserver, it is important to understand
the difference between a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>zone</I
></SPAN
> and a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN
>.</P
><P
>For instance, consider the <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>example.com</SPAN
> domain
which includes names such as <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>host.aaa.example.com</SPAN
>
and <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>host.bbb.example.com</SPAN
> even
though the <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>example.com</SPAN
>
zone includes only delegations for the
<SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>aaa.example.com</SPAN
>
and <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>bbb.example.com</SPAN
> zones.
A zone can map exactly to a single domain, but could also include
only part of a domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other
nameservers. Every name in the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> tree is a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN
>,
even if it is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>terminal</I
></SPAN
>, that is, has no <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>subdomains</I
></SPAN
>.
Every subdomain is a domain and every domain except the root is
also a subdomain. The terminology is not intuitive and we suggest
that you read RFCs 1033, 1034 and 1035 to gain a complete understanding
of this difficult and subtle topic.</P
><P
>Though <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</SPAN
> is a Domain Nameserver, it deals primarily in
terms of zones. The master and slave declarations in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>named.conf</TT
> file
specify zones, not domains. When you ask some other site if it is willing
to be a slave server for your <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
></SPAN
>, you are
actually asking for slave service for some collection of zones.</P
><P
>Each zone will have one <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>primary master</I
></SPAN
> (also
called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>primary</I
></SPAN
>) server which loads the zone
contents from some local file edited by humans or perhaps generated
mechanically from some other local file which is edited by humans.
There there will be some number of <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>slave</I
></SPAN
> (also
called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>secondary) </I
></SPAN
>servers, which load the zone
contents using the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> protocol (that is, the secondary servers
will contact the primary and fetch the zone data using TCP). This
set of servers &#8212; the primary and all of its secondaries &#8212; should be
listed in the NS records in the parent zone and will constitute a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>delegation</I
></SPAN
>.
This set of servers must also be listed in the zone file itself,
usually under the <B
CLASS="command"
>@</B
> name which indicates the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>top
level</I
></SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>root</I
></SPAN
> of the current zone.
You can list servers in the zone's top-level <B
CLASS="command"
>@</B
> NS
records that are not in the parent's NS delegation, but you cannot
list servers in the parent's delegation that are not present in
the zone's <B
CLASS="command"
>@</B
>.</P
><P
>Any servers listed in the NS records must be configured as <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>authoritative</I
></SPAN
> for
the zone. A server is authoritative for a zone when it has been
configured to answer questions for that zone with authority, which
it does by setting the "authoritative answer" (AA) bit in reply
packets. A server may be authoritative for more than one zone. The
authoritative data for a zone is composed of all of the Resource
Records (RRs) &#8212; the data associated with names in a tree-structured
name space &#8212; attached to all of the nodes from the top node of the
zone down to leaf nodes or nodes above cuts around the bottom edge
of the zone.</P
><P
>Adding a zone as a type master or type slave will tell the
server to answer questions for the zone authoritatively. If the
server is able to load the zone into memory without any errors it
will set the AA bit when it replies to queries for the zone. See
RFCs 1034 and 1035 for more information about the AA bit.</P

This means that the server caches the information that it receives

a fixed list of other servers. The forwarded queries are also known
as <SPAN

></SPAN
>, the same type as a client would
send to a server. There may be one or more servers forwarded to,
and they are queried in turn until the list is exhausted or an answer
is found. A forwarding server is typically used when you do not
wish all the servers at a given site to interact with the rest of
the Internet servers. A typical scenario would involve a number
of internal <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> servers and an Internet firewall. Servers unable
to pass packets through the firewall would forward to the server
that can do it, and that server would query the Internet <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> servers
on the internal server's behalf. An added benefit of using the forwarding
feature is that the central machine develops a much more complete
cache of information that all the workstations can take advantage
of.</P
><P
>There is no prohibition against declaring a server to be a
forwarder even though it has master and/or slave zones as well;
the effect will still be that anything in the local server's cache
or zones will be answered, and anything else will be forwarded using
the forwarders list.</P

authoritatively for a zone, but is not listed in that zone's NS

of a zone, without having to edit the zone on a remote nameserver.
Where the master file for a zone resides on a stealth server in
this way, it is often referred to as a "hidden primary" configuration.
Stealth servers can also be a way to keep a local copy of a zone
for rapid access to the zone's records, even if all "official" nameservers
for the zone are inaccessible.</P
