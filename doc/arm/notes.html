<a name="relnotes_license"></a>License Change</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </p>
    <p>
      This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with
      or without modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone
      redistributing it without changes. Therefore, this change will be
      without consequence for most individuals and organizations who are
      using BIND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/" target="_top">
      https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/</a>.

<a name="win_support"></a>Legacy Windows No Longer Supported</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      As of BIND 9.11.2, Windows XP and Windows 2003 are no longer supported
      platforms for BIND; "XP" binaries are no longer available for download
      from ISC.

	  Code change #4964, intended to prevent double signatures
	  when deleting an inactive zone DNSKEY in some situations,
	  introduced a new problem during zone processing in which
	  some delegation glue RRsets are incorrectly identified
	  as needing RRSIGs, which are then created for them using
	  the current active ZSK for the zone. In some, but not all
	  cases, the newly-signed RRsets are added to the zone's
	  NSEC/NSEC3 chain, but incompletely -- this can result in
	  a broken chain, affecting validation of proof of nonexistence

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add
	  <span class="command"><strong>root-key-sentinel no;</strong></span> to
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code>.

      </li>
<li class="listitem">

	  Added the ability not to return a DNS COOKIE option when one
	  is present in the request.  To prevent a cookie being returned,
	  add <span class="command"><strong>answer-cookie no;</strong></span> to
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code>. [GL #173]
	</p>
	<p>
	  <span class="command"><strong>answer-cookie no</strong></span> is only intended as a
	  temporary measure, for use when <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>
	  shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet
	  support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch between servers on the
	  same address is not expected to cause operational problems,
	  but the option to disable COOKIE responses so that all
	  servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security
	  mechanism, and should not be disabled unless absolutely
	  necessary.
