    BIND 9.15 is an unstable development release of BIND.
    This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
    have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
    leading up to the stable BIND 9.16 release, this document will be
    updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.

<a name="relnotes_versions"></a>Note on Version Numbering</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    Until BIND 9.12, new feature development releases were tagged
    as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
    for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    More recently, BIND adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
    release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
    releases in the 9.15 branch, only increasing version numbers.
    So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.15.0a1,
    9.15.0a2, 9.15.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.15.0,
    9.15.1, 9.15.2, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first stable release from this development branch will be
    renamed as 9.16.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
    on the 9.16 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
    9.17.

<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    The OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
    cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
    still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
    and random number generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORMS.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    compiler and system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9
    should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
