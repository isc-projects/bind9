    BIND 9.17 is an unstable development release of BIND.
    This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
    have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
    leading up to the stable BIND 9.18 release, this document will be
    updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see the file <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> for a more
    detailed list of changes and bug fixes.

<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code class="filename">libuv</code> asynchronous I/O library and the
    OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead of OpenSSL for
    Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation),
    but OpenSSL is still required for general cryptography operations
    such as hashing and random number generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORMS.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    compiler and system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9
    should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.

          UDP network ports used for listening can no longer simultaneously be
          used for sending traffic.  An example configuration which triggers
          this issue would be one which uses the same
          <em class="replaceable"><code>address:port</code></em> pair for
          <span class="command"><strong>listen-on(-v6)</strong></span> statements as for
          <span class="command"><strong>notify-source(-v6)</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>transfer-source(-v6)</strong></span>.  While this issue affects all
          operating systems, it only triggers log messages (e.g. "unable to
          create dispatch for reserved port") on some of them.  There are
          currently no plans to make such a combination of settings work again.

        <p>
          When a secondary server receives a large incremental zone
          transfer (IXFR), it can have a negative impact on query
          performance while the incremental changes are applied to
          the zone. To address this, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can now
          limit the size of IXFR responses it sends in response to zone
          transfer requests. If an IXFR response would be larger than an
          AXFR of the entire zone, it will send an AXFR resonse instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This behavior is controlled by the <span class="command"><strong>max-ixfr-ratio</strong></span>
          option - a percentage value representing the ratio of IXFR size
          to the size of a full zone transfer. The default is
          <code class="literal">100%</code>. [GL #1515]

          The system-provided POSIX Threads read-write lock implementation is
          now used by default instead of the native BIND 9 implementation.
          Please be aware that glibc versions 2.26 through 2.29 had a
          <a class="link" href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23844" target="_top">bug</a>
          that could cause BIND 9 to deadlock. A fix was released in glibc 2.30,
          and most current Linux distributions have patched or updated glibc,
          with the notable exception of Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) which is a work in
          progress. If you are running on an affected operating system, compile
          BIND 9 with <span class="command"><strong>--disable-pthread-rwlock</strong></span> until a fixed
          version of glibc is available. [GL !3125]
