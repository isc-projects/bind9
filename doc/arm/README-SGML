The BIND v9 ARM master document is now kept in DocBook 5 XML format.

Most of the ARM is in the single file "Bv9ARM-book.xml", with certain
other files included into it:

    - dlz.xml
    - dnssec.xml
    - libdns.xml
    - logging-categories.xml
    - managed-keys.xml
    - notes.xml
    - pkcs11.xml
    - BIND man pages

All of the published ARM formats - HTML, PDF, etc - are generated from
this master source.

The file "notes.xml" contains the release notes for the current release. In
addition to being included in the ARM as an appendix, it is also built into
a stand-alone document: "notes.pdf" and "notes.html".

Building these these files requires DocBook 5 and dblatex. These are
available as packages in many OS distributes; in debian, for example:

    $ sudo apt-get install docbook5-xml docbook-xml docbook-xsl-ns \
                           docbook-utils dblatex

To build all documentation, run "make doc".

When committing changes or submitting patches, it is only necessary to
edit the XML source (i.e., the files with ".docbook" or ".xml" suffixes);
the files in HTML and man page format are built from the XML source by a
cron job.

If you are familiar with SGML or HTML, editing the DocBook XML is quite
straightforward.  You only need to know what the tags are and how to use
them.  You can find a good resource either for this either online or in
printed form:

    DocBook: The Definitive Guide
    By Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner
    ISBN: 156592-580-7
    1st Edition, October 1999
    Copyright (C) 1999 by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.

The book is available online in HTML format:

After editing documentation, it is useful to check the correctness of the
XML; this can be done using the "xmllint" utility.
