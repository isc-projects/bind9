          The serial number of a dynamically updatable zone can
          now be set using
          <command>rndc signing -serial <replaceable>number</replaceable> <replaceable>zonename</replaceable></command>.
          This is particularly useful with <option>inline-signing</option>
          zones that have been reset.  Setting the serial number to a value
          larger than that on the slaves will trigger an AXFR-style
	  transfer.

	<para>
          When answering recursive queries, SERVFAIL responses can now be
          cached by the server for a limited time; subsequent queries for
          the same query name and type will return another SERVFAIL until
          the cache times out.  This reduces the frequency of retries
          when a query is persistently failing, which can be a burden
          on recursive serviers.  The SERVFAIL cache timeout is controlled
          by <option>servfail-ttl</option>, which defaults to 10 seconds
          and has an upper limit of 30.

          The new <command>rndc nta</command> command can now be used to
          set a "negative trust anchor" (NTA), disabling DNSSEC validation for
          a specific domain; this can be used when responses from a domain
          are known to be failing validation due to administrative error
          rather than because of a spoofing attack. NTAs are strictly
          temporary; by default they expire after one hour, but can be
          configured to last up to one week.  The default NTA lifetime
          can be changed by setting the <option>nta-lifetime</option> in
          <filename>named.conf</filename>.

	  The EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option is now supported for
          authoritative servers; if a query contains an ECS option then
          ACLs containing <option>geoip</option> or <option>ecs</option>
          elements can match against the the address encoded in the option.
          This can be used to select a view for a query, so that different
          answers can be provided depending on the client network.

	  The EDNS EXPIRE option has been implemented on the client

          single-line-per-record format.

          The rate limiter configured by the

          NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
          from those for other types. This helps when using "grafted" zones
          of type forward, for which the parent zone does not contain a
          delegation, such as local top-level domains.  Previously a query
          of type DS for such a zone could cause the zone apex to be cached
          as NXDOMAIN, blocking all subsequent queries.  (Note: This
          change is only helpful when DNSSEC validation is not enabled.
          "Grafted" zones without a delegation in the parent are not a
          recommended configuration.)
