      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.14 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_versions"><info><title>Note on Version Numbering</title></info>
    <para>
      Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.13.0a1,
      9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.13.0,
      9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.14 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.15.

	<para>
	  A new secondary zone option, <command>mirror</command>,
	  enables <command>named</command> to serve a transferred copy
	  of a zone's contents without acting as an authority for the
	  zone. A zone must be fully validated against an active trust
	  anchor before it can be used as a mirror zone. DNS responses
	  from mirror zones do not set the AA bit ("authoritative answer"),
	  but do set the AD bit ("authenticated data"). This feature is
	  meant to facilitate deployment of a local copy of the root zone,
	  as described in RFC 7706. [GL #33]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  BIND now can be compiled against the <command>libidn2</command>
	  library to add IDNA2008 support.  Previously, BIND supported
	  IDNA2003 using the (now obsolete and unsupported)
	  <command>idnkit-1</command> library.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add
	  <command>root-key-sentinel no;</command> to
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. [GL #37]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>dnskey-sig-validity</command> option allows the
	  <command>sig-validity-interval</command> to be overriden for
	  signatures covering DNSKEY RRsets. [GL #145]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Support for QNAME minimization was added and enabled by default
	  in <command>relaxed</command> mode, in which BIND will fall back
	  to normal resolution if the remote server returns something
	  unexpected during the query minimization process. This default
	  setting might change to <command>strict</command> in the future.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When built on Linux, BIND now requires the <command>libcap</command>
	  library to set process privileges.  The adds a new compile-time
	  dependency, which can be met on most Linux platforms by installing the
	  <command>libcap-dev</command> or <command>libcap-devel</command>
	  package. BIND can also be built without capability support by using
	  <command>configure --disable-linux-caps</command>, at the cost of some
	  loss of security.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>validate-except</command> option specifies a list of
	  domains beneath which DNSSEC validation should not be performed,
	  regardless of whether a trust anchor has been configured above
	  them. [GL #237]

  <section xml:id="relnotes_removed"><info><title>Removed Features</title></info>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Workarounds for servers that misbehave when queried with EDNS
	  have been removed, because these broken servers and the
	  workarounds for their noncompliance cause unnecessary delays,
	  increase code complexity, and prevent deployment of new DNS
	  features. See <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
	    xlink:href="https://dnsflagday.net">https://dnsflagday.net</link>
	  for further details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In particular, resolution will no longer fall back to
	  plain DNS when there was no response from an authoritative
	  server.  This will cause some domains to become non-resolvable
	  without manual intervention.  In these cases, resolution can
	  be restored by adding <command>server</command> clauses for the
	  offending servers, specifying <command>edns no</command> or
	  <command>send-cookie no</command>, depending on the specific
	  noncompliance.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To determine which <command>server</command> clause to use, run
	  the following commands to send queries to the authoritative
	  servers for the broken domain:
	</para>
<literallayout>
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +dnssec +nocookie
	  dig soa &lt;zone&gt; @&lt;server&gt; +noedns
</literallayout>
	<para>
	  If the first command fails but the second succeeds, the
	  server most likely needs <command>send-cookie no</command>.
	  If the first two fail but the third succeeds, then the server
	  needs EDNS to be fully disabled with <command>edns no</command>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Please contact the administrators of noncompliant domains
	  and encourage them to upgrade their broken DNS servers. [GL #150]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Previously, it was possible to build BIND without thread support
	  for old architectures and systems without threads support.
	  BIND now requires threading support (either POSIX or Windows) from
	  the operating system, and it cannot be built without threads.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> can no longer use the EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET
	  option for view selection.  In its existing form, the authoritative
	  ECS feature was not fully RFC-compliant, and could not realistically
	  have been deployed in production for an authoritative server; its
	  only practical use was for testing and experimentation. In the
	  interest of code simplification, this feature has now been removed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The ECS option is still supported in <command>dig</command> and
	  <command>mdig</command> via the +subnet argument, and can be parsed
	  and logged when received by <command>named</command>, but
	  it is no longer used for ACL processing. The
	  <command>geoip-use-ecs</command> option is now obsolete;
	  a warning will be logged if it is used in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>.
	  <command>ecs</command> tags in an ACL definition are
	  also obsolete, and will cause the configuration to fail to
	  load if they are used. [GL #32]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>dnssec-keygen</command> can no longer generate HMAC
	  keys for TSIG authentication. Use <command>tsig-keygen</command>
	  to generate these keys. [RT #46404]
	</para>

	  The <command>-r randomdev</command> option to explicitly select

	  <command>nsupdate</command>,
	  <command>dnssec-confgen</command>, and

	  has been removed from the <command>dnssec-signzone</command>
	  command.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Support for ECC-GOST (GOST R 34.11-94) algorithm has been
	  removed from BIND as the algorithm has been superseded by
	  GOST R 34.11-2012 in RFC6986 and it must not be used in new
	  deployments.  BIND will neither create new DNSSEC keys,
	  signatures and digest, nor it will validate them.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Add the ability to not return a DNS COOKIE option when one
	  is present in the request.  To prevent a cookie being returned
	  add 'answer-cookie no;' to named.conf. [GL #173]
	</para>
	<para>
	  <command>answer-cookie</command> is only intended as a temporary
	  measure, for use when <command>named</command> shares an IP address
	  with other servers that do not yet support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch
	  between servers on the same address is not expected to cause
	  operational problems, but the option to disable COOKIE responses so
	  that all servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security mechanism,
	  and should not be disabled unless absolutely necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Remove support for silently ignoring 'no-change' deltas from
	  BIND 8 when processing an IXFR stream.  'no-change' deltas
	  will now trigger a fallback to AXFR as the recovery mechanism.
	</para>
	<para>
	  BIND 9 will no longer build on platforms that doesn't have
	  proper IPv6 support.  BIND 9 now also requires non-broken
	  POSIX-compatible pthread support.  Such platforms are
	  usually long after their end-of-life date and they are
	  neither developed nor supported by their respective vendors.
