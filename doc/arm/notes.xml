  <section xml:id="relnotes_license"><info><title>License Change</title></info>
    <para>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </para>
    <para>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </para>
    <para>
      This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND, with
      or without modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone
      redistributing it without changes. Therefore, this change will be
      without consequence for most individuals and organizations who are
      using BIND.
    </para>
    <para>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <link
      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

	  Attempting to validate improperly unsigned CNAME responses
	  from secure zones could cause a validator loop. This caused

	  When <command>named</command> was reconfigured, failure of some

	  Fixed a bug that was introduced in an earlier development
	  release which caused multi-packet AXFR and IXFR messages to fail

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Due to some incorrectly deleted code, when BIND was
	  built with LMDB, zones that were deleted via
	  <command>rndc delzone</command> were removed from the
	  running server but were not removed from the new zone
	  database, so that deletion did not persist after a

	  Some header files included &lt;isc/util.h&gt; incorrectly as
	  it pollutes with namespace with non ISC_ macros and this should
	  only be done by explicitly including &lt;isc/util.h&gt;.  This
	  has been corrected.  Some code may depend on &lt;isc/util.h&gt;
	  being implicitly included via other header files.  Such
	  code should explicitly include &lt;isc/util.h&gt;.
