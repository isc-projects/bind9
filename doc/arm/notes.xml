	  rndc can be used to set the serial of dynamically updatable
	  zones using "rndc signing -serial # zone".  This is
	  particularly useful with inline zones which have been
	  reset.  The serial should be set to a value larger than
	  that on the slaves.  This will trigger a AXFR style
	  transfer.
