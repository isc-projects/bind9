    <para>
      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>
      file for the full text).
    </para>
    <para>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.
