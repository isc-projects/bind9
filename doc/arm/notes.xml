      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.14 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_versions"><info><title>Note on Version Numbering</title></info>
    <para>
      Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.13.0a1,
      9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.13.0,
      9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.14 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.15.

      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>

    </para>
    <para>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.
