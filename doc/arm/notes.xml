      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.14 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_versions"><info><title>Note on Version Numbering</title></info>
    <para>
      Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.13.0a1,
      9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.13.0,
      9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.14 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.15.

	  BIND now can be compiled against the <command>libidn2</command>
	  library to add IDNA2008 support.  Previously, BIND supported
	  IDNA2003 using the (now obsolete and unsupported)
	  <command>idnkit-1</command> library.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add
	  <command>root-key-sentinel no;</command> to
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>dnskey-sig-validity</command> option allows the

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> can no longer use the EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET
	  option for view selection.  In its existing form, the authoritative
	  ECS feature was not fully RFC-compliant, and could not realistically
	  have been deployed in production for an authoritative server; its
	  only practical use was for testing and experimentation. In the
	  interest of code simplification, this feature has now been removed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The ECS option is still supported in <command>dig</command> and
	  <command>mdig</command> via the +subnet argument, and can be parsed
	  and logged when received by <command>named</command>, but
	  it is no longer used for ACL processing. The
	  <command>geoip-use-ecs</command> option is now obsolete;
	  a warning will be logged if it is used in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>.
	  <command>ecs</command> tags in an ACL definition are
	  also obsolete, and will cause the configuration to fail to
	  load if they are used. [GL #32]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>dnssec-keygen</command> can no longer generate HMAC
	  keys for TSIG authentication. Use <command>tsig-keygen</command>
	  to generate these keys. [RT #46404]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

	  Support for OpenSSL 0.9.x has been removed.  OpenSSL version
	  1.0.0 or greater, or LibreSSL is now required.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>configure --enable-seccomp</command> option,

      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>
      file for the full text).
    </para>
    <para>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.

      BIND 9.13 is an unstable development branch. When its development
      is complete, it will be renamed to BIND 9.14, which will be a
      stable branch.

    <para>
      The end of life date for BIND 9.14 has not yet been determined.
      For those needing long term support, the current Extended Support
      Version (ESV) is BIND 9.11, which will be supported until at
      least December 2021. See
