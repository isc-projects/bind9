          To prevent exhaustion of server resources by a maliciously configured
          domain, the number of recursive queries that can be triggered by a
          request before aborting recursion has been further limited. Root and
          top-level domain servers are no longer exempt from the
          <command>max-recursion-queries</command> limit. Fetches for missing
          name server address records are limited to 4 for any domain. This
          issue was disclosed in CVE-2020-8616. [GL #1388]
