          When running on a system with support for Linux capabilities,
          <command>named</command> drops root privileges very soon after system
          startup. This was causing a spurious log message, "unable to set
          effective uid to 0: Operation not permitted", which has now been
          silenced. [GL #1042] [GL #1090]

          When <command>named-checkconf</command> was run, it would sometimes
          incorrectly set its exit code. It reflected only the status of the
          last view found; any errors found for other configured views were not
          reported. Thanks to Graham Clinch. [GL #1807]

          When built without LMDB support, <command>named</command> failed to
          restart after a zone with a double quote (") in its name was added
          with <command>rndc addzone</command>. Thanks to Alberto Fernández.
