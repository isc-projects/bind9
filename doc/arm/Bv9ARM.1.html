The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) consists of the syntax to specify the names of entities in the Internet in a hierarchical manner, the rules used for delegating authority over names, and the system implementation that actually maps names to Internet addresses. DNS data is maintained in a group of distributed hierarchical databases.</P>

1.4	Discussion of Domain Name System (DNS) Basics and BIND</H3>
</OL>
<P CLASS="2LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997414">
 </A>
The purpose of this document is to explain the installation and basic upkeep of the BIND software package, and we begin by reviewing the fundamentals of the domain naming system as they relate to BIND. BIND consists of a <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
nameserver</EM>
 (or &quot;daemon&quot;) called <CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
named</CODE>
 and a <CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
resolver</CODE>
 library. The BIND server runs in the background, servicing queries on a well known network port. The standard port for UDP and TCP, usually port 53, is specified in<CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
 /etc/services</CODE>
. The <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
resolver</EM>
 is a set of routines residing in a system library that provides the interface that programs can use to access the domain name services.</P>

1.4.1	Nameservers</H4>
</OL>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997416">
 </A>
A nameserver (NS) is a program that stores information about named resources and responds to queries from programs called <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
resolvers</EM>
 which act as client processes. The basic function of an NS is to provide information about network objects by answering queries.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997417">
 </A>
With the nameserver, the network can be broken into a hierarchy of domains. The name space is organized as a tree according to organizational or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree, called a domain, is given a label. The name of the domain is the concatenation of all the labels of the domains from the root to the current domain. This is represented in written form as a string of labels listed from right to left and separated by dots. A label need only be unique within its domain. The whole name space is partitioned into areas called <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
zones</EM>
, each starting at a domain and extending down to the leaf domains or to domains where other zones start. Zones usually represent administrative boundaries. For example, a domain name for a host at the company <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
Example, Inc.</EM>
 would be:</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued1">
<A NAME="pgfId=997418">
 </A>
<EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
ourhost.example.com</EM>
</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997419">
 </A>
The top level domain for corporate organizations is <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
com</EM>
; <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
example</EM>
 is a subdomain of <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
.com</EM>
; and <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
ourhost</EM>
 is the name of the host.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997420">

The specifications for the domain nameserver are defined in RFC1034, RFC1035 and RFC974. These documents can be found in<BR>

1.4.2	Types of Zones</H4>
</OL>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997422">
 </A>
As we stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in the DNS tree. A zone consists of those contiguous parts of the domain tree for which a domain server has complete information and over which it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to other zones. A delegation point has one or more NS records in the parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at the root of the delegated zone (i.e., the &quot;@&quot; name in the zone file).</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997423">
 </A>
To properly operate a nameserver, it is important to understand the difference between a <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
zone</EM>
 and a <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
domain</EM>
.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997424">
 </A>
As an example, consider the <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
example.com</EM>
 domain, which includes names such as <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
host.aaa.example.com </EM>
and <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
host.bbb.example.com</EM>
 even though the <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
example.com</EM>
 zone includes only delegations for the <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
aaa.example.com</EM>
 and <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
bbb.example.com</EM>
 zones. A zone can map exactly to a single domain, but could also include only part of a domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other nameservers. Every name in the DNS tree is a <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
domain</EM>
, even if it is <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
terminal</EM>
, that is, has no <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
subdomains</EM>
. Every subdomain is a domain and every domain except the root is also a subdomain. The terminology is not intuitive and it is suggested that you read RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035 to gain a complete understanding of this difficult and subtle topic.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=1007878">
 </A>
Though BIND is a Domain Nameserver, it deals primarily in terms of zones. The primary and secondary declarations in the <CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
named.conf</CODE>
 file specify zones, not domains. When you ask some other site if it is willing to be a secondary server for your <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
domain</EM>
, you are actually asking for secondary service for some collection of zones.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997426">
 </A>
Each zone will have one <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
primary master</EM>
 (also called <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
primary</EM>
) server which loads the zone contents from some local file edited by humans or perhaps generated mechanically from some other local file which is edited by humans. There there will be some number of <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
secondary master </EM>
servers, which load the zone contents using the DNS protocol (that is, the secondary servers will contact the primary and fetch the zone data using TCP). This set of servers--the primary and all of its secondaries--should be listed in the NS records in the parent zone and will constitute a <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
delegation</EM>
. This set of servers must also be listed in the zone file itself, usually under the <CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
@</CODE>
 name which indicates the <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
top level</EM>
 or <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">
root</EM>
 of the current zone. You can list servers in the zone's top-level <CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
@</CODE>
 NS records that are not in the parent's NS delegation, but you cannot list servers in the parent's delegation that are not present in the zone's <CODE CLASS="Program-Process">
@</CODE>
.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997428">
 </A>
Any servers listed in the NS records must be configured as <A NAME="marker=997427">
 </A>
authoritative for the zone. A server is authoritative for a zone when it has been configured to answer questions for that zone with authority, which it does by setting the &quot;authoritative answer&quot; (AA) bit in reply packets. A server may be authoritative for more than one zone. The authoritative data for a zone is composed of all of the Resource Records (RRs)--the data associated with names in a tree-structured name space--attached to all of the nodes from the top node of the zone down to leaf nodes or nodes above <A NAME="marker=997429">
 </A>
cuts around the bottom edge of the zone.</P>
<P CLASS="3LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997430">
 </A>
Adding a zone as a type master or type slave will tell the server to answer questions for the zone authoritatively. If the server is able to load the zone into memory without any errors it will set the AA bit when it replies to queries for the zone. See RFCs 1034 and 1035 for more information about the AA bit.</P>

Instead of interacting with the nameservers for the root and other domains, a <EM CLASS="EquationVariables">

the same type as a client would send to a server. There may be one or more servers forwarded to, and they are queried in turn until the list is exhausted or an answer is found. A forwarding server is typically used when you do not wish all the servers at a given site to interact with the rest of the Internet servers. A typical scenario would involve a number of internal DNS servers, and an internet firewall. The servers which cannot pass packets through the firewall would forward to the server which can, which would ask the internet DNS servers on the internal server's behalf. An added benefit of using the forwarding feature is that the central machine develops a much more complete cache of information that all the workstations can take advantage of. </P>
<P CLASS="4LevelContinued">
<A NAME="pgfId=997442">

There is no prohibition against declaring a server to be a forwarder even though it has master and/or slave zones as well; the effect will still be that anything in the local server's cache or zones will be answered, and anything else will be forwarded using the forwarders list.</P>

A stealth server is a server that answers authoritatively for a zone, but is not listed in that zone's NS records. Stealth servers can be used as a way to centralize distribution of a zone, without having to edit the zone on a remote nameserver. Where the master file for a zone resides on a stealth server in this way, it is often referred to as a &quot;hidden primary&quot; configuration. Stealth servers can also be a way to keep a local copy of a zone for rapid access to the zone's records, even if all &quot;official&quot; nameservers for the zone are inaccessible.</P>
