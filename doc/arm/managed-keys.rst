Dynamic Trust Anchor Management
-------------------------------

BIND is able to maintain DNSSEC trust anchors using :rfc:`5011` key
management. This feature allows ``named`` to keep track of changes to
critical DNSSEC keys without any need for the operator to make changes
to configuration files.

Validating Resolver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure a validating resolver to use :rfc:`5011` to maintain a trust
anchor, configure the trust anchor using a ``dnssec-keys`` statement and
the ``initial-key`` keyword. Information about this can be found in
:ref:`trust-anchors`.

Authoritative Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up an authoritative zone for :rfc:`5011` trust anchor maintenance,
generate two (or more) key signing keys (KSKs) for the zone. Sign the
zone with one of them; this is the "active" KSK. All KSKs which do not
sign the zone are "stand-by" keys.

Any validating resolver which is configured to use the active KSK as an
RFC 5011-managed trust anchor will take note of the stand-by KSKs in the
zone's DNSKEY RRset, and store them for future reference. The resolver
will recheck the zone periodically, and after 30 days, if the new key is
still there, then the key will be accepted by the resolver as a valid
trust anchor for the zone. Any time after this 30-day acceptance timer
has completed, the active KSK can be revoked, and the zone can be
"rolled over" to the newly accepted key.

The easiest way to place a stand-by key in a zone is to use the "smart
signing" features of ``dnssec-keygen`` and ``dnssec-signzone``. If a key
with a publication date in the past, but an activation date which is
unset or in the future, " ``dnssec-signzone -S``" will include the
DNSKEY record in the zone, but will not sign with it:

::

   $ dnssec-keygen -K keys -f KSK -P now -A now+2y example.net
   $ dnssec-signzone -S -K keys example.net

To revoke a key, the new command ``dnssec-revoke`` has been added. This
adds the REVOKED bit to the key flags and re-generates the ``K*.key``
and ``K*.private`` files.

After revoking the active key, the zone must be signed with both the
revoked KSK and the new active KSK. (Smart signing takes care of this
automatically.)

Once a key has been revoked and used to sign the DNSKEY RRset in which
it appears, that key will never again be accepted as a valid trust
anchor by the resolver. However, validation can proceed using the new
active key (which had been accepted by the resolver when it was a
stand-by key).

See :rfc:`5011` for more details on key rollover scenarios.

When a key has been revoked, its key ID changes, increasing by 128, and
wrapping around at 65535. So, for example, the key
"``Kexample.com.+005+10000``" becomes "``Kexample.com.+005+10128``".

If two keys have IDs exactly 128 apart, and one is revoked, then the two
key IDs will collide, causing several problems. To prevent this,
``dnssec-keygen`` will not generate a new key if another key is present
which may collide. This checking will only occur if the new keys are
written to the same directory which holds all other keys in use for that
zone.

Older versions of BIND 9 did not have this precaution. Exercise caution
if using key revocation on keys that were generated by previous
releases, or if using keys stored in multiple directories or on multiple
machines.

It is expected that a future release of BIND 9 will address this problem
in a different way, by storing revoked keys with their original
unrevoked key IDs.
