Release Notes for BIND Version 9.13.0

Introduction

BIND 9.13 is an unstable development release of BIND. This document
summarizes new features and functional changes that have been introduced
on this branch. With each development release leading up to the stable
BIND 9.14 release, this document will be updated with additional features
added and bugs fixed.

Note on Version Numbering

Prior to BIND 9.13, new feature development releases were tagged as
"alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release for a given
development branch, which always ended in ".0".

Now, however, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable" release
numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta" releases in the
9.13 branch, only increasing version numbers. So, for example, what would
previously have been called 9.13.0a1, 9.13.0a2, 9.13.0b1, and so on, will
instead be called 9.13.0, 9.13.1, 9.13.2, etc.

The first stable release from this development branch will be renamed as
9.14.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue on the 9.14 branch,
while unstable feature development proceeds in 9.15.

Download

The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at http://
www.isc.org/downloads/. There you will find additional information about
each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Security Fixes

  * None.

New Features

  * BIND now can be compiled against the libidn2 library to add IDNA2008
    support. Previously, BIND supported IDNA2003 using the (now obsolete
    and unsupported) idnkit-1 library.

  * named now supports the "root key sentinel" mechanism. This enables
    validating resolvers to indicate to which trust anchors are configured
    for the root, so that information about root key rollover status can
    be gathered. To disable this feature, add root-key-sentinel no; to
    named.conf.

  * The dnskey-sig-validity option allows the sig-validity-interval to be
    overriden for signatures covering DNSKEY RRsets. [GL #145]

Removed Features

  * dnssec-keygen can no longer generate HMAC keys for TSIG
    authentication. Use tsig-keygen to generate these keys. [RT #46404]

  * Support for OpenSSL 0.9.x has been removed. OpenSSL version 1.0.0 or
    greater, or LibreSSL is now required.

  * The configure --enable-seccomp option, which formerly turned on
    system-call filtering on Linux, has been removed. [GL #93]

  * IPv4 addresses in forms other than dotted-quad are no longer accepted
    in master files. [GL #13] [GL #56]

  * IDNA2003 support via (bundled) idnkit-1.0 has been removed.

  * The "rbtdb64" database implementation (a parallel implementation of
    "rbt") has been removed. [GL #217]

  * The -r randomdev option to explicitly select random device has been
    removed from the ddns-confgen, rndc-confgen, nsupdate, dnssec-confgen,
    and dnssec-signzone commands.

    The -p option to use pseudo-random data has been removed from the
    dnssec-signzone command.

Feature Changes

  * BIND will now always use the best CSPRNG (cryptographically-secure
    pseudo-random number generator) available on the platform where it is
    compiled. It will use arc4random() family of functions on BSD
    operating systems, getrandom() on Linux and Solaris, CryptGenRandom on
    Windows, and the selected cryptography provider library (OpenSSL or
    PKCS#11) as the last resort. [GL #221]

  * BIND can no longer be built without DNSSEC support. A cryptography
    provder (i.e., OpenSSL or a hardware service module with PKCS#11
    support) must be available. [GL #244]

  * Zone types primary and secondary are now available as synonyms for
    master and slave, respectively, in named.conf.

  * named will now log a warning if the old root DNSSEC key is explicitly
    configured and has not been updated. [RT #43670]

  * dig +nssearch will now list name servers that have timed out, in
    addition to those that respond. [GL #64]

  * dig +noidnin can be used to disable IDN processing on the input domain
    name, when BIND is compiled with IDN support.

  * Up to 64 response-policy zones are now supported by default;
    previously the limit was 32. [GL #123]

  * Several configuration options for time periods can now use TTL value
    suffixes (for example, 2h or 1d) in addition to an integer number of
    seconds. These include fstrm-set-reopen-interval, interface-interval,
    max-cache-ttl, max-ncache-ttl, max-policy-ttl, and min-update-interval
    . [GL #203]

Bug Fixes

  * None.

End of Life

BIND 9.13 is an unstable development branch. When its development is
complete, it will be renamed to BIND 9.14, which will be a stable branch.

The end of life date for BIND 9.14 has not yet been determined. For those
needing long term support, the current Extended Support Version (ESV) is
