Release Notes for BIND Version 9.9.13

Introduction

This document summarizes significant changes since the last production
release of BIND on the corresponding major release branch. Please see the
CHANGES file for a further list of bug fixes and other changes.

Download

The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at http://
www.isc.org/downloads/. There you will find additional information about
each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Legacy Windows No Longer Supported

As of BIND 9.9.11, Windows XP and Windows 2003 are no longer supported
platforms for BIND; "XP" binaries are no longer available for download
from ISC.

Security Fixes

  * When recursion is enabled but the allow-recursion and
    allow-query-cache ACLs are not specified, they should be limited to
    local networks, but they were inadvertently set to match the default
    allow-query, thus allowing remote queries. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2018-5738. [GL #309]

New Features

  * named now supports the "root key sentinel" mechanism. This enables
    validating resolvers to indicate which trust anchors are configured
    for the root, so that information about root key rollover status can
    be gathered. To disable this feature, add root-key-sentinel no; to
    named.conf.

Feature Changes

  * None.

Bug Fixes

  * named now rejects excessively large incremental (IXFR) zone transfers
    in order to prevent possible corruption of journal files which could
    cause named to abort when loading zones. [GL #339]

  * rndc reload could cause named to leak memory if it was invoked before
    the zone loading actions from a previous rndc reload command were
    completed. [RT #47076]

End of Life

BIND 9.9 (Extended Support Version) will be supported until June, 2018, at
which time this final maintenance release will be published for the
branch. The new Extended Support Version is BIND 9.11, which will be
supported until at least December, 2021. See https://www.isc.org/downloads
/software-support-policy/ for details of ISC's software support policy.
