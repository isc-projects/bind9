<A NAME="Usage"><H3>Definition and Usage</H3></A>

The <CODE>trusted-keys</CODE>
statement is for use with DNSSEC-style security, originally specified
in RFC 2065.  DNSSEC is meant to 
provide three distinct services: key distribution, data origin
authentication, and transaction and request authentication.  A
complete description of DNSSEC and its use is beyond the scope of this
document, and readers interested in more information should start with
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2065.txt">
RFC 2065</A> and then continue with the
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/dnssec.html">
Internet Drafts</A>.</P>

<P>Each trusted key is associated with a domain name.  Its attributes are
the non-negative integral <VAR>flags</VAR>, <VAR>protocol</VAR>, and
<VAR>algorithm</VAR>, as well as a base-64 encoded string representing
the key.</P>

A trusted key is added when a public key for a non-authoritative zone is
known, but cannot be securely obtained through DNS.  This occurs when
a signed zone is a child of an unsigned zone.  Adding the trusted
key here allows data signed by that zone to be considered secure.</P>
