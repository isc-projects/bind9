<PRE>
key <VAR>key_id</VAR> {
  algorithm <VAR>algorithm_id</VAR>;
  secret <VAR>secret_string</VAR>;
};

<HR>

<A NAME="Usage"><H3>Definition and Usage</H3></A>

<P>The <CODE>key</CODE> statement defines a key ID which can be used
in a <A HREF="server.html"><CODE>server</CODE></A> statement to
associate an authentication method with a particular name server.

<P>A key ID must be created with the <CODE>key</CODE>
statement before it can be used in a <CODE>server</CODE>
definition or an address match list.</P>

<P>The <VAR>algorithm_id</VAR> is a string that specifies a
security/authentication algorithm.
<VAR>secret_string</VAR> is the secret to be used by the algorithm,
and is treated as a base-64 encoded string.

<P>The <CODE>key</CODE> statement is intended for use in transaction
security.  Unless included in a <A HREF="server.html"><CODE>server</CODE></A>
statement, it is not used to sign any requests.  It is used to verify
requests matching the <VAR>key_id</VAR> and <VAR>algorithm_id</VAR>,
and sign replies to those requests.
