.SH NAME
runmdn \- A script to allow applications to use multilingual domain names.
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrunmdn\fP [\fB-e\fP \fIlocal-codeset\fP] \fIprogram-name\fP [\fIargs..\fP]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B runmdn
enables applications to use multilingual domain names without recompilation.
Just add ``runmdn'' before the application-name, and the application
can handle non-ASCII domain names.  For example, you can do:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
\f(CW% runmdn telnet \fInon-ASCII-hostname\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Before using runmdn, you should set up properties related to
multilingual DNS by configuring mDNkit's configuration file
\fBmdn.conf\fP.
See mdn.conf(5) which describes the configuration.
.\"
.SH OPTION
The following option is available:
.TP 4
\fB\-e\fP \fIlocal-codeset\fP
Specify the application's local codeset.
If the option is not specified,
.B runmdn
guesses the codeset from the current locale.
See the ``NOTE'' section for more details about local codeset.
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.B runmdn
is a small shell script that sets up an environment variable called
``LD_PRELOAD'', so that an application dynamically links a shared
library ``libmdnresolv'' before any other shared libraries.
.PP
The library ``libmdnresolv'' provides a special version of
resolver functions which implement features for handling multilingual
domain names.
.B runmdn
replaces the following functions with the special version:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.ft CW
gethostbyname
gethostbyname2
gethostbyaddr
gethostbyname_r
gethostbyname2_r
gethostbyaddr_r
getipnodebyname
getipnodebyaddr
freehostent
getaddrinfo
freeaddrinfo
getnameinfo
.ft R
.fi
.RE
.PP
By overriding them in the standard libraries with the special version
provided by ``libmdnresolv'',
.B runmdn
enables applications to use multilingual domain names.
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 2
These API functions accept non-ASCII domain names
encoded in the local codeset that the application is using.
Also the result from these APIs may contain non-ASCII domain names.
.IP \(bu 2
The normalization and codeset conversion between application's local
codeset and the codeset used in DNS protocol data are handled
automatically, so users/applications need not worry about them.
.RE
.PP
Properties of multilingual DNS (such as the normalization or the codeset
used on DNS protocol data) can be configured with the mDNkit's
configuration file (
.B mdn.conf
).  See mdn.conf(5) for details.
.\"
.SH NOTE
Unless
\fB\-e\fP
option is specified,
.B runmdn
tries to guess the application's local codeset from the application's current
locale.
However, sometimes it cannot guess the codeset correctly, for example
if the application does not set the locale appropriately
by calling `setlocale()'.
In that case, you can explicitly specify the local codeset by setting an
environment variable ``MDN_LOCAL_CODESET''.
See the section ``LOCAL CODESET'' in mdn.conf(5) for details.
.PP
The idea of using ``LD_PRELOAD'' to replace some functions in the standard
library was taken from ``runsocks'' script distributed as part of SOCKS5
reference implementation.
.SH BUGS
There are many cases where
.B runmdn
does not work.
.PP
Your system must support ``LD_PRELOAD'' mechanism in the first place.
.PP
Due to security reasons, ``LD_PRELOAD'' mechanism is disabled for
setuid programs in any sane systems.  So
.B runmdn
does not work for setuid programs such as ping or rsh.
.PP
If your application uses a function other than the ones runmdn supports for
name resolution, you lose.
