Major changes in version 1.2:

* New encoding converters for `BRACE' and `LACE' are implemented.

* New normalize schemes `ja-compose-voiced-sound', 'ja-kana-fullwidth'
  and 'ja-alnum-halfwidth' introduced.

* mDN Wrapper is thoroughly overhauled.
  - Log level can be specified by using GUI (or directly editing the
    registry Software\JPNIC\MDN\LogLevel).  Note that fine grain
    control over logging is supported only by the MDN library (libmdn).
    Log output from mDN Wrapper itself can be turned on or off, but
    no log level support.
  - Log file can also specified.
  - Some serious bugs are fixed, including incorrect program-side
    encoding (codeset) detection.
  - Advanced configuration feature implemented.  Now DNS encoding and
    normalization can be customizable.  Also you can configure which
    winsock DLL to be wrapped.

* dnsproxy and mDN Wrapper now correctly accept and process client-
  supplied domain names encoded in the alternate encoding.  Previously
  worked correctly only when the alternate encoding happened to be the
  same as the server encoding.

* 8bit-through patch for BIND-8.2.2-P5 is replaced by a new patch
  for BIND-8.2.2-P7.

* A buffer overrun bug in RACE converter is fixed.


Major changes in version 1.1:

* Log level of dnsproxy can be specified with ``log-level'' entry.
  available levels are `none', `fatal', `warning' and `trace'.  See
  dnsproxy.8 or dnsproxy.conf.sample for details.

* Sending SIGHUP to dnsproxy causes it to close and re-open the log file.
  Useful for log file turnover.

* If log file is not specified, dnsproxy uses the default log file
  /tmp/dnsproxy.log.  Previously behavior was that no logging was done
  at all, conflicting with what document says.

* dnsproxy won't terminate even if recvfrom() returns unexpected
  errors such as `connection refused (ECONNREFUSED)'.  On Linux, it is
  reported that it sometimes returns this error even for
  connection-less (ie UDP) sockets.

* DNS message ID allocation/release bugs in dnsproxy are fixed.
  Previously dnsproxy seems to stop working if it receives more than
  4096 requests in 10 minutes.

* RACE conversion bug is fixed.  Previously, if the prefix part contains
  any uppercase letters (such as "Bq--"), it is not recognized as a
  RACE prefix.
