.SH NAME
mdnres.conf \- configuration file for the mDNkit client-side library
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
@ETCDIR@/mdnres.conf
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mdnres.conf
is read by the client-side resolver which is multilingualized
(internationalized) using mDNkit.
This file specifies various properties regarding multilingual domain names
such as:
.RS 4
\- the encoding of domain names in DNS protocol.
.br
\- normalization schemes.
.br
\- the alternative encoding which is used in case the domain name in
   the DNS reply message cannot be convertible to the local encoding.
.br
\- encoding name aliases.
.RE
.PP
This file is a simple text file, and each line in the file
(other than comment lines that begin with # and empty lines) forms an entry
of the following format:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\fIkeyword\fP\ \fIvalue..\fP
.fi
.RE
\."
.SH "SERVER ENCODING ENTRY"
Server encoding entry specifies the encoding name (codeset name) which
is used as the encoding of multilingualized domain names by the DNS protocol.
.PP
The syntax of this entry is:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\f(CWserver-encoding \fP\fIencoding\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fIencoding\fP is the encoding name to be used, and any of the following
names can be specified.
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 2
``UTF-8''
.IP "\(bu" 2
``RACE''
.IP "\(bu" 2
``BRACE''
.IP "\(bu" 2
``LACE''
.IP "\(bu" 2
``UTF-5''
.IP "\(bu" 2
Codeset names which iconv_open() library function accepts.  Please
consult iconv() documentation for the available codesets.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Any alias names for the above, defined by the alias file.
(See section ``ENCODING ALIAS ENTRY'')
.RE
.SH "SERVER ZLD ENTRY"
Some of the encodings used by internationalized name servers (the one
specified by `server-encoding' entry) requires ZLD (zero-level domain),
additional toplevel domain that is hidden from users/applications.
This entry specifies the ZLD.
.PP
The syntax of this entry is:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\f(CWserver-zld \fP\fIZLD\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that this entry is ignored unless mDNkit is configured with
\f(CW--enable-zld\fR so that its ZLD support is enabled.
.SH "NORMALIZATION ENTRY"
Normalization entry specifies the normalization schemes which should be
applied to the domain names before sending them to name servers.
.\"
The syntax of this entry is:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\f(CWnormalize \fP\fIscheme\fP [\fIscheme\fP..]
.fi
.RE
.PP
.I scheme
is the normalization scheme, and following shows the currently available
schemes:
.RS 4
.TP 4
\f(CWascii-lowercase\fP
Convert ASCII uppercase letters to lowercase.
.TP 4
\f(CWascii-uppercase\fP
Convert ASCII lowercase letters to uppercase.
.TP 4
\f(CWunicode-lowercase\fP
Convert Unicode uppercase letters to lowercase, based on ``Unicode
Technical Report #21: Case Mappings''.
Note that only locale-independent conversion is supported.
.TP 4
\f(CWunicode-uppercase\fP
Convert Unicode lowercase letters to uppercase, based on ``Unicode
Technical Report #21: Case Mappings''.
Note that only locale-independent conversion is supported.
.TP 4
\f(CWunicode-form-c\fP
Perform Unicode normalization called ``Unicode Normalization Form C''.
.TP 4
\f(CWunicode-form-kc\fP
Perform Unicode normalization called ``Unicode Normalization Form KC''.
.TP 4
\f(CWja-compose-voiced-sound\fP
Compose Japanese full-width hiragana/katakana character and the following
(semi) voiced sound mark (dakuten or han-dakuten in Japanese) into a
single combined letter if such letter exists.
.TP 4
\f(CWja-kana-fullwidth\fP
Convert Japanese half-width kana characters to full-width.
.TP 4
\f(CWja-alnum-halfwidth\fP
Convert full-width alphabets, digits and minus sign to half-width.
.TP 4
\f(CWja-minus-hack\fP
Convert Japanese full-width minus sign
(Unicode ``MINUS SIGN'') to ``\-'' (Unicode ``HYPHEN-MINUS'').
.RE
.PP
More than one
.I schemes
can be specified.
If multiple schemes are specified, they are applied in turn.
.SH "ALTERNATIVE ENCODING ENTRY"
The resolver library multilingualized by mDNkit automatically
determines the local codeset the application uses, and tries to
convert domain names in a DNS reply message to the codeset.
However, it is possible that the conversion fails because some
characters in the domain names have no mapping to the local codeset.
This occurs, for example, when a Japanese application using Japanese
codeset receives a DNS reply containing Chinese characters which
are not included in the Japanese character set.
.PP
Alternative encoding entry specifies the codeset name to be used
instead of the local codeset in case the above problem happens.
.PP
The syntax of this entry is:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\f(CWalternate-encoding \fP\fIencoding\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.I encoding
is the name of the codeset.  It must be an ASCII-compatible
encoding such as RACE.
.\"
.SH "ENCODING ALIAS ENTRY"
Encoding alias entry specifies the file containing codeset name aliases.
The aliases can be used just as the real names.
.PP
The syntax of this entry is:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\f(CWalias-file \fP\fIpathname\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.I pathname
specifies the path name of the alias file.
The alias file is a simple text file, consisting of lines of the form:
.PP
.RS 8
.nf
\fIalias-name\fP\ \fIname\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.I alias-name
is the alias name to be defined, and
.I name
is the real name or another alias name.
.\"
.SH "LOCAL CODESET"
.B mdnres.conf
does not have an entry to specify the local codeset, since
it is determined from the application's current locale information.
So each application can use different local codeset.
.PP
Although mDNkit tries hard to find out the local codeset, sometimes it
fails.  For example, there are applications which use non-ASCII codeset
but work in C locale.  In this case, you can specify the application's
local codeset by an environment variable ``MDN_LOCAL_CODESET''.
Just set the codeset name (or its alias name) to the variable, and
mDNkit will use the codeset as the local one, regardless of the locale
setting.
.SH "SAMPLE CONFIGURATION"
The following shows a sample configuration file.
.RS 4

#

# Use RACE as the DNS protocol encoding.

# Use lowercase conversion and Normalization Form KC for normalization.
