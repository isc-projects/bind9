.SH OVERVIEW
The
.B libmdn
library supports various manipulations of multilingual domain names,
including:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
encoding convesion
.IP \- 2
normalization
.RE
.PP
.B Libmdn
is designed according to IDNA framework where each application must do
necessary preparations for the multilingual domain names before passing them
to the resolver.
.PP
To help applications do the preparation, libmdn provides easy-to-use,
high-level interface for the work.
.PP
This manual describes only a small subset of the API that libmdn provides,
most important functions for application programmers.  For other API,
please refer to the mDNkit's specification document (which is not yet
available) or the libmdn's header files typically found under
`/usr/local/include/mdn/' on your system.
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B mdn_nameinit
function initializes the whole library, and reads the default
configuration file
.BR mdn.conf ,
which includes configuration parameters for multilingual domain name
preparation.
If
.B mdn_nameinit
is called more than once, the library initialization will take place
only at the first call while the configuration file will be (re)read
at every call.
.PP
If there are no errors,
.B mdn_nameinit
returns
.BR mdn_success .
Otherwise, the returned value indicates the cause of the error.
See the section ``RETURN VALUES'' below for the error codes.
.PP
Usually you don't have to call this function explicitly because
it is implicitly called when
.B mdn_encodename
or
.B mdn_decodename
is first called without prior calling of
.BR mdn_nameinit .
.\"
.PP
.B mdn_encodename
function performs normalization and encoding conversion on the 
multilingual domain name specified by
.IR from ,
and stores the result to
.IR to ,
whose length is specified by 
.IR tolen .
.I actions
is a bitwise-OR of the following flags, specifying which subprocesses in
the encoding process are to be employed.
.RS 2

.B mdn_decodename
function performs the reverse of
.BR mdn_encodename .
It converts the multilingual domain name given by

which is represented in a special encoding called ACE,
to the application's local codeset and stores into
.IR to ,
whose length is specified by
.IR tolen .
.I actions
specifies which subprocesses in decoding process take place, as in
.BR mdn_encodename ,
except that only \f(CWMDN_IDNCONV\fP, \f(CWMDN_NAMEPREP\fP and
\f(CWMDN_LOCALCONV\fP are allowed.
Details of this decoding process can be found in the section ``NAME DECODING''.

All of the functions above return error code of type
.BR mdn_result_t .
All codes other than

.SH "NAME ENCODING"
Name encoding is a process that transforms the specified
multilingual domain name to a certain string suitable for name
resolution.
.BR libmdn 's
name encoding process consists of the following steps.
.IP "(1) Encoding conversion (local codeset to UCS)"
Convert the encoding of the given domain name to
Unicode/ISO10646 UTF-8 format string.
The source encoding must be one of the two encodings below:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
The application's local encoding (codeset).
.IP \- 2
ACE specified by the configuration file.
.RE
The latter is suppored because name decoding process may produce
ACE strings when its attempt to convert to the local encoding fails.
See the section ``NAME DECODING'' for details.
.IP "(2) Local mapping"
Apply any locale/language-specific mapping.  This process is
further divided into two subprocesses:
.RS 2
.IP "(2-1) Delimiter mapping"
Map certain characters to the domain name delimiter (U+002E).
.IP "(2-2) Local mapping based on TLD"
Apply character mapping whose rule is determined by the TLD of the name.
.RE
.IP "(3) NAMEPREP"
Perform name preparation (NAMEPREP), which is a standard process for
normalizing multilingual domain names.  This process includes checking
of characters which are not allowed in multilingual domain names.
.IP "(4) Encoding conversion (UCS to ACE)"
Convert the NAMEPREPed name to a special encoding designed for representing
multilingual domain names 
.br
The encoding is also known as ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding) since
a string in the encoding is just like a traditional ASCII domain name
consisting of only letters, numbers and hyphens.
.PP
There are many configuration parameters for this process, such as the
ACE or the local mapping rules.  These parameters are read from the
default mDNkit's configuration file,
.BR mdn.conf .
See mdn.conf(5) for details.
.PP
The libmdn API allows to skip some of these subprocesses.
For example step (1) can be skipped if you have names already in
UTF-8 format.
.\"
.SH "NAME DECODING"
Name decoding is a reverse process of the name encoding.
It transforms the specified
multilingual domain name in a special encoding suitable for name
resolution to the normal name string in the application's current codeset.
However, name encoding and name decoding are not symmetric.
Name decoding doesn't perform local mapping.
Both name encoding and decoding do NAMEPREP, but decoding does
it to verfiy a name, while encoding does it to normalize a name.
.PP
.BR libmdn 's
name decoding process consists of the following steps.
.IP "(1) Encoding conversion (ACE to UCS)"
Convert the encoding of the given domain name
from a special one designed for representing
multilingual domain names (ACE) to Unicode/ISO10646 UTF-8.
.IP "(2) NAMEPREP check"
Perform name preparation (NAMEPREP) as also done in name encoding,
and compare the result of NAMEPREP and the given UCS name.
If the NAMEPREP is failed or the names are different, the given
name is considered as invalid domain name.
It contains a character which is never seen in a NAMEPREPed domain
name.
.IP "(3) Encoding conversion (UCS to local codeset)"
Convert the encoding of the name from UTF-8 to
the application's local codeset.
The local codeset is determined by the application's locale.
.br
However, it is possible that the conversion to the application's
local codeset fails because the name includes some characters
which don't have mappings to the local codeset.
In this case, libmdn tries instead to convert to ACE specified by
the configuration file.  
.PP
The configuration parameters for this process,
are also read from the configuration file
.BR mdn.conf .
.PP
The libmdn API allows to skip some of these subprocesses.
For example step (2) can be skipped if you want a name in
UTF-8 format.
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

.B libmdn
