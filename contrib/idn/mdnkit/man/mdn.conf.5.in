.SH NAME
mdn.conf \- configuration file for internationalized domain name handling
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
@sysconfdir@/mdn.conf
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mdn.conf
is a configuration file for mDNkit,
which is a toolkit for handling internationalized/multilingualized
domain names.
.PP
To use internationalized domain names in DNS or other protocols, they
must be converted to an appropriate format before further processing.
In mDNkit, this conversion process is comprised of the following tasks.
.IP 1. 3
Convert the given domain name in application's local codeset to Unicode,
and vice versa.
.IP 2. 3
Map certain characters in the name to period character so that they are
treated as the domain name
delimiter (\fIdelimiter mapping\fR).
.IP 3. 3
Map certain characters in the name to other characters or chracter sequences,
according to a mapping rule determined by its top level domain (TLD).
.IP 4. 3
Perform NAMEPREP, which is a starndard name preparation process for
internationalized domain names.  This process is composed of
the tree steps called mapping, normalization and prohibited character
checking.
.IP 5. 3
Convert the nameprepped name to IDN encoding, which is the standard encoding
for internationalized domain names (also known as ASCII-compatible encoding,
ACE), and vice versa.
.PP
.B mdn.conf
specifies the parameters for these tasks, such as:
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
the encoding of internationalized domain names (IDN encoding).
.IP \- 2
NAMEPREP schemes.
.RE
.\"
.SH SYNTAX
.B mdn.conf
is a simple text file, and each line in the file
(other than comment lines, which begin with ``#'', and empty lines)
forms an entry of the following format:

.fi
.RE

.IP "\(bu" 2

.RE
.PP
The NAMEPREP process consists of the following 3 subprocesses.
.IP 1. 3
mapping, which maps certain characters in a name to other characters,
possibly none.
.IP 2. 3
normalization, which replaces character variants in a name to
a unique one.
.IP 3. 3
prohibited/unassigned character checking, which detects invalid
characters in a name.
.PP
This entry is a shorthand for specifying all of them at once.

.SH "SETFILE FORMAT"
A setfile defines a set of characters, and is used for specifying
prohibited/unasssigned characters.  The set is specified by
enumerating either individual character codepoints or ranges of
character codepoints.
.PP
A setfile is also a simple text file, and each line specifies a single
character codepoint, or a range of codepoints as follows:

.RE
.\"
.SH "LOCAL CODESET"
.B mdn.conf
does not have an entry to specify the local codeset, since
it is determined from the application's current locale information.
So each application can use different local codeset.
.PP
Although mDNkit tries hard to find out the local codeset, sometimes it
fails.  For example, there are applications which use non-ASCII codeset
but work in C locale.  In this case, you can specify the application's
local codeset by an environment variable ``\fBMDN_LOCAL_CODESET\fR''.
Just set the codeset name (or its alias name) to the variable, and
mDNkit will use the codeset as the local one, regardless of the locale
setting.
