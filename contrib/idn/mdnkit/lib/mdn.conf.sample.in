# `idn-encoding' entry specifies the encoding name used as the encoding
# of multilingualized names by resolvers and DNS servers.  Currently, the
# following encodings are available:
#
#	RACE
#	BRACE
#	LACE
#	DUDE
#	UTF-6
#	UTF-8

# mDNkit currently supports the following version:

#	nameprep-03		-- name preparation scheme described in the
#				   IETF draft `idn-nameprep-03'
