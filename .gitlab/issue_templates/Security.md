### Security Issue

If the bug you are reporting is potentially security-related - for example,
if it involves an assertion failure or other crash in `named` that can be
triggered repeatedly - then please do *NOT* report it here, but send an
email to [security-officer@isc.org](security-officer@isc.org).
