# The bind.keys file is used to override the built-in DNSSEC trust anchors\n\
# which are included as part of BIND 9.  The only trust anchors it contains\n\
# are for the DNS root zone (\".\").  Trust anchors for any other zones MUST\n\
# be configured elsewhere; if they are configured here, they will not be\n\
# recognized or used by named.\n\
#\n\
# To use the built-in root key, set \"dnssec-validation auto;\" in the\n\
# named.conf options, or else leave \"dnssec-validation\" unset.  If\n\
# \"dnssec-validation\" is set to \"yes\", then the keys in this file are\n\
# ignored; keys will need to be explicitly configured in named.conf for\n\
# validation to work.  \"auto\" is the default setting, unless named is\n\
# built with \"configure --disable-auto-validation\", in which case the\n\
# default is \"yes\".\n\
#\n\
# This file is NOT expected to be user-configured.\n\
#\n\
# Servers being set up for the first time can use the contents of this file\n\
# as initializing keys; thereafter, the keys in the managed key database\n\
# will be trusted and maintained automatically.\n\
#\n\
# These keys are current as of November 2024.  If any key fails to\n\
# initialize correctly, it may have expired. This should not occur if\n\
# BIND is kept up to date.\n\
#\n\
# See https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml for current trust\n\
# anchor information for the root zone.\n\
