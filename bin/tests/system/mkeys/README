This is for testing managed-keys, in particular with problems
with RFC 5011 Automated Updates of DNSSEC Trust Anchors.

ns1 is the root server that offers new KSKs and hosts one record for
testing. The TTL for the zone's records is 2 seconds.

ns2 is a validator that uses managed-keys.  "-T mkeytimers=2/20/40"
is used so it will attempt do automated updates frequently. "-T tat=1"
is used so it will send TAT queries once per second.

ns3 is a validator with a broken key in managed-keys.

ns5 is a validator which is prevented from getting a response from the
root server, causing key refresh queries to fail.
