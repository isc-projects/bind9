# Creates the system tests output file from the various test.output files. It
# then searches that file and prints the number of tests passed, failed, not
# run.  It also checks whether the IP addresses 10.53.0.[1-8] were set up and,
# if not, prints a warning.
#
# Usage:
#    testsummary.sh [-n]
#
# -n	Do NOT delete the individual test.output files after concatenating
#	them into systests.output.
#
# Status return:
# 0 - no tests failed
# 1 - one or more tests failed
