; isctest.asyncserver does no special handling of DNAME records (e.g. by
; occluding names below them or synthesizing CNAMEs), so the following
; DNAME records are only returned for certain trigger QNAMEs (see
; CnameThenDnameHandler.get_responses() in ans3/ans.py) or if they are
; queried for explicitly.
