# Shell script snippet, must be sourced.
#
# Most system tests require use of at least two ports: the nameserver query
# port and a port for RNDC access.  In addition, some tests require additional
# ports (e.g. for tests of transfers between nameservers).
#
# To allow tests to run in parallel, each test must be allocated a unique set
#Â ports to use.
#
# This script is used during testing to parse the "-p" option on the command
# line invoking scripts used during the test.  The option sets the base of
# a block of 10 ports used by the test.  A shell symbol is set for each port:
#
# port         Port used for queries (default to 5300)
# aport1       First additional port (set to $port + 1)
#   :
# aport8       Eighth additional port (set to $port + 8)
# controlport  Port used for RNDC (set to $port + 9)
#
# The fiule also defines a simple shell function to 

port=5300
