# Run all the system tests.

# Usage:
#    runall.sh [-n] [numprocesses]
#
#   -n          Noclean.  Keep all output files produced by all tests.  These
#               can later be removed by running "cleanall.sh".
#
#   numprocess  Number of concurrent processes to use when running the tests.
#               The default is one, which causes the tests to run sequentially.
#               (This is ignored when running on Windows as the tests are always
#               run sequentially on that platform.)
