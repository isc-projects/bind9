 * PASSED and FAILED mean the particular test passed or failed.
 *
 * UNKNOWN means that for one reason or another, the test process itself
 * failed.  For instance, missing files, error when parsing files or
 * IP addresses, etc.  That is, the test itself is broken, not what is
 * being tested.
 *
 * UNTESTED means the test was unable to be run because a prerequisite test
 * failed, the test is disabled, or the test needs a system component
 * (for instance, Perl) and cannot run.
