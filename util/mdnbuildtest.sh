# XXXDCL This is currently much too specific to the environment in which
# it was written (NetBSD 1.5_alpha2 with libiconv in /usr/local/lib).  It
# is essentially just a copy of the commands I used to test building of
# the mdnkit contributed source, and needs to be better generalized. 

# Directory was prepared with:
# cvs export -r {tag} bind9
# cd bind9
